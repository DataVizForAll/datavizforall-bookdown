# Leaflet Map Templates

While quite a number of solutions exist for the interactive mapping of geospatial data, most either (a) charge monthly for individual use and storage of map data and provide limited extensiblity or (b) produce heavy-loadtime maps using proprietary B.I. technology, most of which are neither responsive for all device sizes nor ideal for the modern web.
 
For these reasons and more, [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) –– an open-source JavaScript library
for mobile-friendly interactive maps –– has quickly become the lightweight framework of choice among most data visualization practitioners. 

Yes, Leaflet does rely on JavaScript, but even those unfamiliar with JS can, with a little effort, produce unique interactive maps with their own datasets. Because Leaflet is open-source and available to fork or download on [Github](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), hundreds of users have contributed to its improvement, development and maintenance over time. The Leaflet community has also built numerous extensions in the form of [plugins](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html) and map templates.

We'll start out by looking at the components of a basic Leaflet map.
