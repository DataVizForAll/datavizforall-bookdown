REVISE TITLE? -- Choose Tools to Picture Your Data Story

Do you feel overwhelmed by the enormous range of data visualization tools? There's been so many different tools released in recent years that anyone would have a hard time deciding which ones to use. Even if you limit your choices to the dozen or so tools specifically mentioned in this book, how do you make wise decisions?

- [Draw and Write Your Data Story](draw.html) reminds us to start with the most important item in your toolkit: ***your story***. Begin by drawing pictures and writing questions or sentences to capture your ideas on paper, and then choose the most appropriate tools to create your vision.
- [Ask Questions When Choosing Tools](ask.html) lists several criteria to consider when making software decisions. Many of us look for free or affordable tools in the perfect sweet spot---easy-to-learn, yet powerful---and that's the focus of this book.
- [Rate Three Simple Map Tools](rate.html) invites readers to create a basic interactive point map using three different online tools, and to evaluate each one using selected criteria from the chapter above.

## Draw and Write Your Data Story {- #draw}
Before you dive deeply into software, think about the most important item in your toolkit: **your story**. The primary reason we're designing visualizations is to improve how we communicate our data story to other people, so let's begin there.

Push away the computer and pick up some old-school tools:

  - colored markers or pencils
  - lots of blank paper
  - your imagination

First, at the top of the page, write down your data story.

- Is it in the form of a question? If so, figure out how to pose the question.
- Or maybe it's in the form of an answer to that question? If so, spell out your clearest statement.
- If you're lucky, perhaps you already can envision a full story, with a beginning, middle, and end.
- Whatever form it takes in your head, write out the words that come to mind.

Further down the page (or on a separate sheet), draw quick pictures of the visualizations that comes to your mind, even if you don't yet have any data. No artistic skills are required. Just use your imagination.
- Do you envision some type of chart? Sketch a picture.
- Or do you imagine some type of map? Show what it might look like.
- Will your visualization be interactive? Insert arrows, buttons, whatever.

Finally, share your data story with someone else and talk through your preliminary ideas. Does your sketch and sentences help to convey the broader idea that you're trying to communicate? If so, this is one good sign that your data story is worth pursuing, with the visualization tools, templates, and techniques in other chapters of this book.

## Ask Questions When Choosing Tools {- #ask}
When each of us decides which digital tools best fit our needs, we often face trade-offs. On one hand, many of us prefer easy-to-learn tools, especially those with a drag-and-drop interface, but they often force us to settle for limited options. On the other hand, we also favor powerful tools that allow us to control and customize our work, yet most of these require higher-level coding skills. The goal of this book is to find the best of both worlds: that "sweet spot" where tools are both friendly and flexible.

![Diagram: the 'sweet spot' for easy-to-learn and powerful tools](images/01-choose/tool-sweet-spot.png)

Before testing out new tools, try listing the criteria that guide your decision-making process. What are the most important factors that influence whether or not you add another item to your digital toolkit? Here's the list that came to our minds:

1. Price: Is the tool free, or is there a “freemium” model to pay for more features or higher usage?
2. Easy-to-learn: Is the tool relatively simple for new users without coding skills?
3. Power: Does the tool support large amounts of data, and various types of visualizations?
4. Customization: Can I modify details about how my work appears?
5. Data Migration: Can I easily move my data in and out, in case I switch to a different tool? Hint for historians: Future-proof your digital history projects! Choose tools that allow you to easily export and migrate data to other platforms. Design projects to keep your data separate from its digital presentation.
6. Hosting: Can I decide exactly where my data and visualizations will be stored online?
7. Support: Is the tool actively maintained by its creators, and do they answer questions?
8. Open Source: Is the tool’s software visible, can it be modified, and redistributed?
9. Security: Is the tool and my data protected from malicious hackers and malware?
10. Collaborative: Does the tool allow several people to work together on one shared product?
11. Privacy: Under the terms of service, is my data and work private or public?
12. Error-friendly: When something fails, does the tool point out possible problems and solutions?
13. Cross-platform: Does this tool work across different computer operating systems?
14. Mobile-friendly: Will it correctly display my work on various mobile devices and browsers?

That's a long list! It's even longer than the number of tools we'll mention in this book. But don't let it overwhelm you. The diagram at the top of the page illustrates the two most important criteria for the many free tools that are currently available: easy-to-learn and powerful features.

- Many of the free web-based tools in this book require that your publicly share your data. Check each tool and decide whether it is appropriate for your data, which may have some privacy restrictions.

## Rate Three Simple Map Tools {- #rate}
Let's explore criteria from the previous chapter by comparing three different tools, and reflecting on which factors you feel are most important when making decisions about your toolkit. We'll test three drag-and-drop tools to transform sample address data into a simple interactive point map.

Each tool can **geocode** address data by looking up a location (such as 500 Main Street, Hartford CT) in a large database, deciding on the best match, and converting this data into latitude and longitude coordinates (such as 41.762, -72.674).

For our sample data, we'll use this table of 9 locations in North America, with 3 intentional mistakes to test for geocoding errors.

![Image: Sample address data screenshot](images/01-choose/sample-address-screenshot.png)

First, click this link and Save to download the sample file to your computer: [sample-address-data in CSV format](data/sample-address-data.csv). CSV means comma-separated-values, a generic spreadsheet format that many tools can easily open. If you need help with downloading, see this [short video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-04PQldP9HQ).

Next, build a point map with the sample data, by following the tutorials for the three tools below.

| Tool |  Step-by-step tutorial in this book |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/) | [My Maps tutorial](mymaps) |
| [Carto Builder](http://carto.com) | [Carto tutorial](carto) |

Finally, rate your experience using each tool with these selected criteria:

- Easy-to-learn: Which tool was the simplest for creating a basic point map?
- Price: Which of these free tools provided the most services at no cost?
- Customization: Which tool enabled you to modify the most details about your map?
- Data Migration: Which tool most easily allowed you to import and export your data?
- Error-friendly: Which tool geocoded most accurately or signaled possible errors?
