# Tell Your Data Story {#story}
TODO: Write this chapter: Tell the story about your data, including its most meaningful insights and limitations
Write compelling titles, labels, and sentences to accompany your visualization. Call attention to the most meaningful insights in your chart, and explain any data limitations.

TODO: Return to the "Sketch Your Data Story" exercise from the introduction....These three simple steps will help you start sketching out your data story. To be sure, there's much more work to be done, such as finding, cleaning, and visualizing data, which we'll cover in the chapters to come. But transferring ideas from your brain onto paper is the big first step, because making your thoughts visible enables you to act on them more easily. Scribbling words and sketching pictures not only helps *you* to see your thoughts more clearly, but it also allows you to share what's been inside your head more concretely with friends and colleagues. After reflecting on your sheets of paper and listening to feedback, you can cross out not-so-good ideas, replace them with better ones, and add new sheets of paper with more ideas. Finally, you can spread out the sheets on a table, move them around to reorder the sequence, and begin to define the three essential stages of your data story: the beginning, middle, and end. Start to imagine these sheets of paper as preliminary slides for your presentation desk, or paragraphs and pictures for your written report or website. We'll come back to this exercise near the end of the book in [Chapter 16: Telling Your Data Story](story.html)

Write down what your eyes see in your visualization..... and tell us what it matters.....  Despite what you may have been told, tables and charts and maps alone do not tell a story. You need to interpret what the viewers see....

Who's your audience?

What's your storytelling format?

- Many visualization books and workshops assume that you will hand a sheet of paper to people sitting around a board room, or a static PDF document sent via email.... Those formats are fine, but do not reflect the wider range of ways to communicate with people
- a "data walk" to engage community stakeholders https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/72906/2000510-data-walks-an-innovative-way-to-share-data-with-communities.pdf
- presentation slides with live web connection for interactivity (or video screencast)
- website with textual narrative and interactive visualizations
