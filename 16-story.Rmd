# Tell and Show Your Data Story {#story}
TODO: Write concluding chapter!

In this concluding chapter, we'll pull together the knowledge and skills you've developed while reading this book, with final recommendations for sharing true and meaningful data stories. We'll emphasize *storytelling*....

We titled this chapter "Tell and Show" rather reversing it because order matters when communicating data stories. Make a habit to first tell your audience what you found and why it's significant, then show them the visual evidence to support your argument. Don't make the mistake of showing your audience a bunch of data pictures and leaving it up to them to guess what it all means.

Many writers believe in the old saying "show, don't tell," by letting readers experience the story through actions and feelings of characters, rather than a summary description by the author. While that's great advice for fiction writing and advanced non-fiction, our recommendation is very different. Tell your audience what you found in the data, show them the supporting evidence, and then tell them why this insight matters.

Don't show your audience pictures of your data and leave it to them to guess its meaning.

This chapter draws inspiration from Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, *Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals* (Wiley, 2015), http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/book/; Also Alberto Cairo 2019




## Tell and Show the Story {- #tell-and-show}

Let's return to the [Sketch Your Data Story exercise from Chapter 2](sketch.html). We encouraged you to scribble words and sketch pictures on sheets of paper to lay out at least four elements of your story: 1) identify the *problem* that motivates your project, 2) restate it in the form of a *question*, 3) describe how you plan to *find* your data, 4) dream up at least one *visualization* you might create. Spread out these sheets of paper on a table, move them around to reorder the sequence, and begin to define the sequence of your story. Imagine them as preliminary slides for your presentation desk, or paragraphs and pictures for your written report or website.




- Verbalize What Visualization Tells You (Cairo 2019, p89)
Write down what your eyes see in your visualization..... and tell us what it matters.....  Despite what you may have been told, tables and charts and maps alone do not tell a story. You need to interpret what the viewers see....

Who's your audience?

What's your storytelling format?
- Many visualization books and workshops assume that you will hand a sheet of paper to people sitting around a board room, or a static PDF document sent via email.... Those formats are fine, but do not reflect the wider range of ways to communicate with people
- a "data walk" to engage community stakeholders https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/72906/2000510-data-walks-an-innovative-way-to-share-data-with-communities.pdf
- presentation slides with live web connection for interactivity (or video screencast)
- website with textual narrative and interactive visualizations


- Draw Attention to Meaning -- see Change your data to be more flexible with colors and highlights https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/256-a-collection-of-datawrapper-pro-tips
Write compelling titles, labels, and sentences to accompany your visualization.
using color to highlight key items or outliers in your data

- Integrate Story with Your Data
- Decide on Best Mix of Text and Visualization -- text, table, chart, map



- Acknowledge Limitations of the Data  -- Disclose Uncertainty (cite Cairo), visualize it in bar/column and line charts
- Credit Sources and Disclose Uncertainty... to build credibility for your work
