# Tell and Show Your Data Story {#story}
TODO: rewrite section intro after finishing the full chapter draft

In this concluding chapter, we'll pull together the knowledge and skills you've developed while reading this book, with final recommendations for sharing true and meaningful data stories. We'll emphasize *storytelling*....

We titled this chapter "Tell and Show" rather reversing it because order matters when communicating data stories. Make a habit to first tell your audience what you found and why it's significant, then show them the visual evidence to support your argument. Don't make the mistake of showing your audience a bunch of data pictures and leaving it up to them to guess what it all means.

Many writers believe in the old saying "show, don't tell," by letting readers experience the story through actions and feelings of characters, rather than a summary description by the author. While that's great advice for fiction writing and advanced non-fiction, our recommendation is very different. Tell your audience what you found in the data, show them the supporting evidence, and then tell them why this insight matters. Don't show your audience pictures of your data and leave it to them to guess its meaning. Shift your mode from *exploring data* to *expository writing about data*.

This chapter draws inspiration from books by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic and her [Storytelling with Data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com) blog, as well as works by Alberto Cairo.^[@knaflicStorytellingDataData2015; @knaflicStorytellingDataLet2019; @cairoTruthfulArtData2016; @cairoHowChartsLie2019]

## Build a Narrative on a Storyboard {- #storyboard}

Let's return to the [Sketch Your Data Story exercise from Chapter 2](sketch.html). We encouraged you to scribble words and sketch pictures on sheets of paper to lay out at least four initial elements of your story:

- Identify the *problem* that motivates your project.
- Reframe the problem into a researchable *question*.
- Describe your plan to *find* data to answer the question.
- Dream up one or more *visualizations* you might create using imaginary data.

Spread out these sheets like a *storyboard* to define the sequence of your narrative, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:data-story-panel2). Imagine them as preliminary slides for your presentation desk, or paragraphs and pictures for your written report or web page, for how you plan to explain the process to your audience. Or if you prefer digital over paper, another option is to convert blocks of text and images from your sheets into a [Google Slides presentation](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) or a [draft Google Document](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), or your preferred tools for telling the data story. Of course, it's perfectly normal to update the sheets you created at the beginning of your project to reflect changes in your thinking. For example, you may have refined your research question, found new sources during your search, and of course, turned your imagined visualizations into actual tables, charts, or maps with real data.

(ref:data-story-panel2) Sketch out your story idea on four pages: problem, question, find data, visualize.

```{r data-story-panel2, out.width=750, fig.cap="(ref:data-story-panel2)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/02-choose/data-story-panel.png")
 ```

Now let's enrich your storyboard by adding more content about what you actually discovered after searching, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing your data. Select only your most meaningful tables, charts, or maps. Print them out on separate sheets of paper, or download static images or capture screenshots [TODO: link to how-to screenshot in chapter 10 embed] to place them in your draft slides or document. Leave room for you to write text at the top and bottom of each table, chart, or map in order to tell your data story. Here are the next two steps:

- At the top of each key visualization, *verbalize* what your eyes see as its most important message.

Write a one-sentence summary of the most insightful finding for each visualization. Two sentences is also acceptable, but one sentence is better, so if the first version becomes too wordy, rewrite it to focus on the core idea and throw out unnecessary text. Despite the old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words, data visualizations do *not* speak for themselves. Your job is to interpret their meaning for your audience. One of the best ways to translate charts or maps into words is to describe exactly what captures your eye as the designer, and communicate this to your reader, who is seeing it for the first time and relying on your guidance. In every case, you need to decide on the ideal mix of words and images.

- At the bottom of each visualization, tell us *why it matters*, and build up to how audiences should rethink or react.

A good way to discuss the significance of your data story is to focus on how this new information *changes us*. When you discovered interesting patterns in your data visualization, how did it make you feel about the problem you (or your organization) were trying to solve? How did your answers to the research question make you think about the issue in a new or different way? Overall, does your data story inspire you or others to take action in some way? Once again, think about these questions from the perspective of your audience, and find words that capture how the data story should change our mindset, alter our habits, or influence our next steps.

For example, we started our own data storyboard in chapter 2 to define our problem statement: *To learn more about readersâ€™ backgrounds in order to write a better data visualization book that meets their needs.* [TODO: Revise earlier text to match?] We collected data from over 3,000 readers of an earlier draft of this book who responded to our [online survey](https://forms.gle/yn5QwTzfQkYcppQn9) and agreed that we would [publicly share the survey results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1egX_akJccnCSzdk1aaDdtrEGe5HcaTrlOW-Yf6mJ3Uo), as we discussed in [chapter 3](spreadsheets.html). We [cleaned up the data as described in chapter 5](clean.html) because some responses were partially empty or contained locations that could not be accurately geocoded. Then we looked for [meaningful comparisons as described in chapter 6](comparisons.html) and visualized our most interesting results in two ways. We created a [scatter chart as described in chapter 7](chart.html) and also a [point map as described in chapter 8](map.html). For this chapter, we followed our own advice above by writing short summaries at the top of each visualization, and explaining why it matters at the bottom.

What did we learn? First, over 70 percent of readers who responded live outside of North America. Most notably, 35 percent reside in Asia, 20 percent in Europe, 6 percent each in Africa and South America, and 3 percent in Oceania, as shown in the left side of Figure \@ref(fig:survey-combined-annotated). Our first draft of the book mostly included examples from Hartford, Connecticut, where we both worked. While we knew that our book had a global audience, we were surprised to see how many readers---among those who responded to the survey---live outside of the United States. In order to be more inclusive and expand our international audience, we have revised the book to add more sample charts and maps from other regions where readers live. [TODO: we need to work more on this!] Second, we learned that readers who responded to our survey have relatively high levels of education, but limited data visualization experience. In particular, 89 percent reported completing the equivalent of a college degree (16 or more years of schooling), but rated themselves at the lower end of the experiential scale, as shown in the right side of Figure \@ref(fig:survey-combined-annotated). [TODO: ILYA please clarify if 89% are higher ed AND lower scale of experience, or if those are separate.] In our earlier draft of the book, our primary audience were college undergraduates, and we were uncertain about the reading and background levels of other readers. Based on the survey responses, we revised the manuscript to add deeper concepts about data visualization, because we believe most of our readers can grasp them, yet we continue to write at an introductory level that assumes no prior knowledge beyond a secondary school or early college education. Now we can add these new sheets to our storyboard.

(ref:survey-combined-annotated) Verbalize meaningful insights at the top of each visualization, and tell why it matters at the bottom, then insert them into your storyboard.

```{r survey-combined-annotated, out.width=750, fig.cap="(ref:survey-combined-annotated)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/16-story/survey-combined-annotated.png")
```

Insert all of these new sheets (or slides, or blocks of text and images) to your storyboard. Order them in a way that will make sense *to your audience*, who most likely will be seeing all of this content for the first time. While there is no one way to tell a story, consider our advice to avoid making rookie mistakes. First, tell us the problem and question *before* you offer an answer, because our brains expect to receive them in that order. Second, summarize each insight *before* you show us the evidence, because your audience relies on you, the storyteller, to guide us on a journey through the data and what aspects deserve our attention. Describe the forest, not every tree, but point out a few special trees as examples for what makes different parts of the forest stand out.

## Draw Attention to Meaning {- #draw-attention}
When finalizing your visualizations, add finishing touches to draw attention to the most meaningful aspects of the data. In addition to writing text to accompany your charts and maps, you can also add annotations and use colors *inside* some types of visualizations to point out what's most significant in your data story. Let's demonstrate how to use these features to transform your visualization in Datawrapper, a tool we first introduced in [Chapter 7: Chart Your Data](chart.html). This example was inspired by the [Datawrapper Academy site](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/256-a-collection-of-datawrapper-pro-tips).

One of the environmental challenges we face today is the ever-growing production of plastics. While these inexpensive and lightweight materials offer many quality-of-life benefits, we often deposit them in mismanaged waste streams that cause them to enter our rivers and oceans. To understand the growth of plastics, we consulted [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution), and you can view the [annual global production data from 1950-2015 in Google Sheets format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H3OwmiLQy5DugT-iArhuqHryzcWJi1kLocpGp7v-1VM/edit#gid=339613035).

First, let's upload the data in a single-column format to Datawrapper. By default, the tool transforms this time-series data into a line chart, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plastic-line-chart), which shows how global plastic production has increased over time.

```
| year | plastics |
| 1950 |        2 |
| 1951 |        2 |
...
```

(ref:plastic-line-chart) The default GDP line chart on the left, and the reduced-axis chart on the right.

```{r plastic-line-chart, fig.cap="(ref:plastic-line-chart)"}
if(knitr::is_html_output(excludes="markdown")) knitr::include_url("https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5y13d/", height = "475px") else knitr::include_graphics("images/16-story/plastic-line-chart.png")
```

But Figure \@ref(fig:plastic-line-chart) does not yet focus on the bigger story. Our 60 percent of all of the plastics ever manufactured in the world have been made since 2000, or the last 15 years of this chart, according to our analysis of the data.  Let's highlight this broader point by editing the chart in four ways, building on skills you learned in prior chapters. First, divide the data into two columns, *before 2000* and *since 2000*, which allows you to apply different colors to each data series. Insert the same data for year 2000 in both columns to make the new chart look continuous. Second, change the chart type from the default *line chart* to an *area chart* to fill the space under the curve to draw attention to the total amount of plastics manufactured in global history. Third, in the *Refine* tab, since you do *not* want a stacked area chart, uncheck the *stack areas* box. Assign a dark blue color to draw more attention to the post-2000 data series, and a gray color to diminish the appearance of the pre-2000 data series, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plastic-line-chart). Finally, hide the old title and replace it by adding annotations inside the area chart, using colored text, to emphasize the new interpretation. Overall, redesigning your chart helps you to communicate a more meaningful data story that global plastic production is increasing *and* that our world has manufactured more than half of our historical total in just the past 15 years.

```
| year | before 2000 | since 2000 |
| 1999 |         202 |            |
| 2000 |         213 |        213 |
| 2001 |             |        218 |
...
```

(ref:plastic-refine) Explore the [interactive version of the new area chart](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1TyyZ/), which uses color and annotations to draw attention to post-2000 global plastic production.

```{r plastic-refine, fig.cap="(ref:plastic-refine)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/16-story/plastic-refine.png")
```

Now that you have a clearer idea about why and how to draw your audience's attention to the most meaningful aspects of your data story, we'll build on those skills in the next section on acknowledging sources and ambiguous data.

## Acknowledge Sources and Uncertainty {- #sources-uncertainty}
TODO: Write this short section

Build credibility for your work in several ways:

- Tell true data stories. Do not hide or obscure meaningful evidence. Your job is to interpret the meaning of your data visualizations, and caution us against misinterpreting or reading too much into them.
- Credit sources and collaborators on dataviz products and readme files
- Show stages of your work... upload raw data, cleaned data, show calculations in CSV or similar files... Write clear descriptions of key decisions you made when analyzing the data, and include those too... GitHub repo
- Acknowledge Limitations of the Data  -- Disclose Uncertainty (cite Cairo), visualize it in bar/column and line charts

Also use multi-column data to show dashed lines


## Decide On Your Data Story Format {- #story-format}
TODO write this short section

- Many visualization books and workshops assume that you will hand a sheet of paper to people sitting around a board room, or a static PDF document sent via email.... Those formats are fine, but do not reflect the wider range of ways to communicate with people:

- presentation slides with live web connection for interactivity
- website with textual narrative and interactive visualizations
- a video that combines narration (live action or voiceover) with screencasts of your interactive visualizations
- a "data walk" to engage community stakeholders https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/72906/2000510-data-walks-an-innovative-way-to-share-data-with-communities.pdf

Each of these storytelling formats requires you to customize your content to fit. Details are beyond the scope of this book. But consider a few key differences.

SIDEBAR: When presenting your data story as a slide deck:

Here's some recommendations we're raising because presentation tools are still a relatively new format, and many people are still figuring out how best to tell a story that combines text and images, along with the opportunity to share interactive content on the web.

- If you're using interactive visualizations on the web, consider using presentation tools that display slides in your web browser, in order to seamless go back and forth between your slides and interactive web content. For example, you can create a screenshot of an interactive visualization [TODO: link how] and insert that static image in a Google Slide, with a link to the interactive version online.

TODO: insert abstract side-by-side image of a Google Slide with an interactive visualization, plus animated GIF for web edition

- Another reason to share your presentation slides online is to invite your audience to explore your claims and interactive visualizations in more detail, and to reach audiences beyond those who attended your event. Just before you deliver your presentation at a live event, share your slides online, and create a short link [TODO: to bit.ly in chap 3], and if you wish, also share it on your preferred social media platform. In your presentation title slide, add the shortlink and/or your social media link, and remind audiences that they can view all of the details again at their convenience. For your last presentation slide, insert a duplicate of the title slide to show them the link again.

- With presentation slides, consider ways to *tell* and *show* us the data story by repeating key elements in sequence. For example, imagine this three-slide sequence about your key data findings the middle of your presentation. In the first slide, summarize the key insight at the top. In the second slide, keep this short summary at the top and show us the visualization evidence below it. In the third slide, continue to show the visualization evidence, but replace the summary text at the top with a statement about why this matters and what action your audience should take. In other words, repeat key elements across slides to build continuity between text and images, rather than separating them.

TODO: insert abstract sequence of three slides: summary at top, summary with viz, significance with viz

In the middle of your presentation, imagine or example, on one slide, you can summarize the key insight in text at the top.

### Summary {- #summary16}
TODO
Tell the story about your data, including its most meaningful insights and limitations
 Call attention to the most meaningful insights in your chart, and explain any data limitations.
