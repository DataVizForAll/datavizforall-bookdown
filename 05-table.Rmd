# Table Your Data {#table}

Before you leap into designing colorful charts or maps, consider that in some cases, the best way to present data may be through a table. In this chapter, you'll learn how to create an interactive table, which allows users to sort columns from low-to-high values, and search results to see specific rows. Interactive tables are most appropriate when you expect that your readers want to dig a bit into the data to see details for their local community, such as TODO: mention Wash Post story on opiod epidemic by county, or any listing of school data.

TODO: write chapter, with three examples:

- published Google Sheet
- Datawrapper
- Airtable, if you have a relational database

See the Embed chapter for how to place these in a web page
