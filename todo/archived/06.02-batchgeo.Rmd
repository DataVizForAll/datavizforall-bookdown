## Simple Point Map with BatchGeo {#batchgeo}
*last updated March 16, 2017*

**TO DO**: BatchGeo changed terms of service to limit free map views to 100. This means that my demo maps may no longer be viewable by users. We should consider pros and cons of dropping this tool from the book.

#### Tutorial {-}

Let's build a simple point map with sample data. This tool is so easy that most readers probably will skip over this tutorial.

1) Click the link and Save the file to your computer: [sample-address-data in CSV format](data/sample-address-data.csv). CSV means comma-separated-values, a generic spreadsheet format that many tools can easily open.

2) Open BatchGeo in your browser at <http://batchgeo.com>

3) Drag-and-drop the address file into BatchGeo. Or, open the CSV file with any spreadsheet tool, then copy and paste the address data into the web interface. Or, use the BatchGeo template if needed.

4) Click the Validate & Set Options button to review your data, or the Map Now button.

5) BatchGeo will attempt to geocode your address data and display an interactive point map. Colored markers include pop-up data windows.

6) Click the Save and Continue button. Add map title, select Public or Unlisted, and insert your email address.

7) BatchGeo emails you a link to edit your map, or to embed the iframe code in your own website. To learn more, go to the [Embed on Your Web](embed) chapters in this book.
