Hi Jack,
I wrote up some steps (see PDF) to make custom Town polygons in Tableau, using your population density data. Hopefully the steps are clear but let me know if you have any questions! Follow the link below to download the excel workbook with the polygon data for Tableau. The attached steps should walk you through creating a map with a year slider like this:

The excel file is here:

Let me know if you have any questions.
