data format and slide presentation notes

Each of these storytelling formats requires you to customize your content to fit. Details are beyond the scope of this book. But consider a few key differences.

SIDEBAR: When presenting your data story as a slide deck:

Here's some recommendations we're raising because presentation tools are still a relatively new format, and many people are still figuring out how best to tell a story that combines text and images, along with the opportunity to share interactive content on the web.

- If you're using interactive visualizations on the web, consider using presentation tools that display slides in your web browser, in order to seamless go back and forth between your slides and interactive web content. For example, you can create a screenshot of an interactive visualization [TODO: link how] and insert that static image in a Google Slide, with a link to the interactive version online.

TODO: insert abstract side-by-side image of a Google Slide with an interactive visualization, plus animated GIF for web edition

- Another reason to share your presentation slides online is to invite your audience to explore your claims and interactive visualizations in more detail, and to reach audiences beyond those who attended your event. Just before you deliver your presentation at a live event, share your slides online, and create a short link [TODO: to bit.ly in chap 3], and if you wish, also share it on your preferred social media platform. In your presentation title slide, add the shortlink and/or your social media link, and remind audiences that they can view all of the details again at their convenience. For your last presentation slide, insert a duplicate of the title slide to show them the link again.

- With presentation slides, consider ways to *tell* and *show* us the data story by repeating key elements in sequence. For example, imagine this three-slide sequence about your key data findings the middle of your presentation. In the first slide, summarize the key insight at the top. In the second slide, keep this short summary at the top and show us the visualization evidence below it. In the third slide, continue to show the visualization evidence, but replace the summary text at the top with a statement about why this matters and what action your audience should take. In other words, repeat key elements across slides to build continuity between text and images, rather than separating them.

TODO: insert abstract sequence of three slides: summary at top, summary with viz, significance with viz

In the middle of your presentation, imagine or example, on one slide, you can summarize the key insight in text at the top.
