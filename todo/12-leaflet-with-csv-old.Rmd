TODO: REWRITE this to serve as a more advanced version using repo https://github.com/HandsOnDataViz/leaflet-map-csv rather than leaflet-map-simple (used in ch8)

This tutorial introduces more sophisticated Leaflet map code templates (http://leafletjs.com) that you can modify and host online with GitHub in your browser (http://github.com). You will learn how to:

- A) Fork (copy) Leaflet template to your GitHub account
- B) Publish your live map to public web with GitHub Pages
- C) Modify your map title and add layer controls
- D) Geocode addresses [in a Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z_0hKbw8Ff_fdp-XRoRL4YWe6ue0c0EpITveZ2rz1e8/) and upload points from data.csv

Code templates help us to move beyond the limits of drag-and-drop web mapping services (such as Google MyMaps) and to create more customized visualizations on a web server that you control. Before you begin, learn the broad concepts in the chapter introduction [Edit and Host Code with GitHub](github.html). If you have problems with this tutorial, go to the [Fix Common Problems](fix.html) section of the appendix.

#### A) Fork (copy) Leaflet template to your GitHub account {-}
Before you begin, sign up for a free GitHub account: http://github.com

1) Right-click to open this GitHub code template in a new tab: https://github.com/handsondataviz/leaflet-map-csv

2) In the upper-right corner of the code template, sign in to your free GitHub account

3) In the upper-right corner, click Fork to copy the template (also called a code repository, or repo) into your GitHub account. The web address (URL) of the new copy in your account will follow this format:

`https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY`

Reminder: You can only fork a GitHub repo **one time**. If needed, see how to make a second copy in the [Create a New Repo in GitHub](create-repo.html) chapter in this book.

#### B) Publish your live map to public web with GitHub Pages {-}

4) In your new copy of the code repo, click on Settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages area, select Master, and Save. This publishes your code template to a live map on a public website that you control.

5) Scroll down to GitHub Pages section again, to select and copy the link to your published web site, which will follow this format:

`https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`

6) Scroll up to the top, and click on your repo name to go back to its main page.

7) At the top level of your repo main page, click on README.md, and click the pencil icon to edit this file, written in easy-to-read Markdown code.

8) Delete the link to the current live site, and paste in the link to your site. Scroll down and Commit to save your edits.

9) On your repo main page, right-click on the link to your published site to open in a new tab. **Be patient** during busy periods, because your website may take up to 1 minute to appear the first time.

#### C) Modify your map title and add layer controls {-}

10) Go back to your browser tab for your code repo. Click on the index.html file (which contains the map code), and click the pencil icon to edit it.

11) Explore the map code, which contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Look for sections that begin with "EDIT" for items that you can easily change. Scroll down to Commit your changes.

12) Go to your live website browser tab and refresh the page to view your edits. **Be patient** during busy periods, when some edits may take up to 1 minute to appear.

13) To change your map title in the index.html file, click the pencil symbol (to edit) and go to lines 23-25. Replace "EDIT your map title" with your new title:

TODO: decide if these triple backtic snippets will stay, or if they will throw errors into Markdown output

```HTML
<!-- Display the map and title with HTML division tags  -->
<div id="map-title">EDIT your map title</div>
<div id="map"></div>
```

14) To change your initial map zoom level, edit the index.html file and go to line 33. The zoom range for this map is from 1 (max zoom out) to 18 (max zoom in).
```JavaScript
// Set up initial map center and zoom level
var map = L.map('map', {
  center: [41.77, -72.69], // EDIT latitude, longitude to re-center map
  zoom: 12,  // EDIT from 1 to 18 -- decrease to zoom out, increase to zoom in
  scrollWheelZoom: false
});
```

15) To change the default basemap, edit lines 46 and 52 to delete “.addTo(map)” from the Carto light layer, then add it to the Stamen colored terrain layer. DO NOT erase the semicolons!

Your original code looks like this (scroll to right to see all):
```JavaScript
/* Carto light-gray basemap tiles with labels */
  var light = L.tileLayer('https://cartodb-basemaps-{s}.global.ssl.fastly.net/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>, &copy; <a href="https://carto.com/attribution">CARTO</a>'
  }).addTo(map); // EDIT - insert or remove ".addTo(map)" before last semicolon to display by default
  // controlLayers.addBaseLayer(light, 'Carto Light basemap');
  /* Stamen colored terrain basemap tiles with labels */
  var terrain = L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles.a.ssl.fastly.net/terrain/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: 'Map tiles by <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a>. Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">ODbL</a>.'
  }); // EDIT - insert or remove ".addTo(map)" before last semicolon to display by default
  // controlLayers.addBaseLayer(terrain, 'Stamen Terrain basemap');
```

After you edit the code, it should look like this (scroll to right to see all):
```JavaScript
/* Carto light-gray basemap tiles with labels */
var light = L.tileLayer('https://cartodb-basemaps-{s}.global.ssl.fastly.net/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>, &copy; <a href="https://carto.com/attribution">CARTO</a>'
}); // EDIT - insert or remove ".addTo(map)" before last semicolon to display by default
// controlLayers.addBaseLayer(light, 'Carto Light basemap');
/* Stamen colored terrain basemap tiles with labels */
var terrain = L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles.a.ssl.fastly.net/terrain/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: 'Map tiles by <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a>. Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">ODbL</a>.'
}).addTo(map); // EDIT - insert or remove ".addTo(map)" before last semicolon to display by default
// controlLayers.addBaseLayer(terrain, 'Stamen Terrain basemap');
```

16) To add a control panel that turns on/off map layers, delete the code comment symbols (//) that appear in front of lines 38-41, 47, and 53 to activate these sections. When you remove code comments in GitHub, the color changes from gray text (inactive code) to colored text (active code). After you remove the code comments, your file should look like this (scroll to right to see all):
```JavaScript
/* Control panel to display map layers */
 var controlLayers = L.control.layers( null, null, {
  position: "topright",
  collapsed: false
 }).addTo(map);

/* Carto light-gray basemap tiles with labels */
var light = L.tileLayer('https://cartodb-basemaps-{s}.global.ssl.fastly.net/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>, &copy; <a href="https://carto.com/attribution">CARTO</a>'
}); // EDIT - insert or remove ".addTo(map)" before last semicolon to display by default
 controlLayers.addBaseLayer(light, 'Carto Light basemap');
/* Stamen colored terrain basemap tiles with labels */
var terrain = L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles.a.ssl.fastly.net/terrain/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: 'Map tiles by <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a>. Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">ODbL</a>.'
}).addTo(map); // EDIT - insert or remove ".addTo(map)" before last semicolon to display by default
 controlLayers.addBaseLayer(terrain, 'Stamen Terrain basemap');
```
17) To change one point on the map, you could edit the latitude and longitude coordinates of the single marker in lines 55-57. To find coordinates for any location and to learn more, go to http://www.latlong.net

```JavaScript
/* Display a blue point marker with pop-up text */
L.marker([41.77, -72.69]).addTo(map) // EDIT latitude, longitude to re-position marker
.bindPopup("Insert pop-up text here"); // EDIT pop-up text message
```
But a better way to display several points is to remove the code comment symbols (//) in front of lines 60-69 to activate this section of code, which pulls map points from the data.csv file in your GitHub repository. After your edits, this section should look like this (scroll right to see all):
```JavaScript
/* Upload Latitude/Longitude markers from data.csv file, show Title in pop-up, and override initial center and zoom to fit all in map */
 var customLayer = L.geoJson(null, {
  onEachFeature: function(feature, layer) {
    layer.bindPopup(feature.properties.Title);
  }
 });
 var runLayer = omnivore.csv('data.csv', null, customLayer)
 .on('ready', function() {
  map.fitBounds(runLayer.getBounds());
 }).addTo(map);
 controlLayers.addOverlay(customLayer, 'Markers from data.csv');
```

#### D) Geocode addresses in Google Sheet and upload points from data.csv {-}

18) A better way to display multiple points on your map is to prepare and upload a new data.csv file to your GitHub repository. First, right-click to open this Google Sheets template in a new tab: [Leaflet Maps Simple data points with Geocoder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z_0hKbw8Ff_fdp-XRoRL4YWe6ue0c0EpITveZ2rz1e8/)

19) Since this sheet is view-only, you cannot edit it. Instead, sign in to your Google account in the upper-right corner.

20) Go to File > Make a Copy, which will save a duplicate version to your Google Drive, which you can edit.

21) In your copy of the Google Sheet, select any cells and press Delete on your keyboard to erase contents. Type new titles and addresses into columns A and B.

22) To geocode your new addresses (which means converting them into latitude and longitude coordinates), select all of the contents across 6 columns, from Address (B) to Source (G).

23) Go to the Geocoder menu that appears in this special Google Sheet template, and select any service, such as US Census (for US addresses) or Google Maps. The first time you run the geocoder, the script will ask for permission.

24) After you have geocoded your addresses, go to File > Download As > Comma-separated values (.CSV format) to save the file to your computer.

25) In your computer, right-click the downloaded file to rename it to: data.csv

26) In your GitHub repository, click Upload Files, then drag-and-drop your new data.csv file, and Commit to upload it. Go to your live map browser tab and refresh to view changes. **Be patient* during busy periods, when some edits may take up to 1 minute to appear.**
