#### Convert Connecticut town names with CTNamecleaner {-}

In Connecticut, residents often list their village or neighborhood names in their address, but these do not necessarily match the official list of 169 Connecticut town governments (called county subdivisions by the US Census). For example, the Elmwood neighborhood is located in the town of West Hartford, and the Rockville village is located in the town of Vernon.

To solve this problem, the data experts at TrendCT/CT Mirror have openly shared a wonderful tool to convert village/neighborhood names into official towns, called CTNamecleaner.
