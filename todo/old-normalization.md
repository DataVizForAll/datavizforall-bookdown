Different ways to normalize data: You can normalize data in many ways, and there is not necessarily one
acceptable way of doing it.

One of the most common ways of normalization is deriving "per capita", or "per person" values.
If values are small, such as rare disease cases or lottery winners, they can be presented as "per 1,000" or "per 100,000" people.
Divide your quantity by population in that area to derive per capita values.

Choropleth maps work well with percentages. The good news is, humans like percentages too.
It is quite natural for us to understand that a 9% unemployment rate means that of 100 people
who were willing to work, nine were unable to find a job. To derive a percentage for unemployment,
divide the number of unemployed people by labor force size (adult
population who are willing and able to work), and multiply by 100.



How not to normalize values: Absolute values are very important for context. Saying that "20% of blond men living in
in town X won the lottery" may sound like a catchy headline, but in reality
the town has 450 residents, of those 200 are men, and of those only 5 have light hair color.
One of those five (and here comes the 20%) was lucky to win the lottery, so technically
the headline didn't lie.

This is, of course, an extreme and comic example, but exaggerations in this spirit are not uncommon.
If you want readers to trust you, make sure you are open about total counts when reporting
normalized values (such as percentages or per capita values).

Absolute values are important for another reason: behind numbers there are often people,
and smaller, normalized values may hide the scale of the problem.
Saying that "the unemployment rate is only 5%" is valid, but the 5%
of, say, Indian labor force (around 522 million) is about 26 million, which is
pretty much the total population of Australia.

Exercise your best judgement when you normalize values. Make sure you don't
blow numbers out of proportion by normalizing values in smaller populations.
But also don't hide large counts behind smaller percentages for larger populations.

At this point, you should have enough geocoding and spreadsheet skills to aid you
with map making. In the following section, we will talk about geographical data in general and
will introduce different geospatial file formats to ensure you are
ready to create, use, and share map data.
