# Highcharts Code Templates {#highcharts}
*by [Ilya Ilyankou and Jack Dougherty](authors), last updated March 21, 2017*

While beginners appreciate the drag-and-drop chart tools and tutorials described earlier in this book, such as [Google Sheets](google-sheets) and [Tableau Public](tableau-public), more advanced users may wish to customize their visualizations, add more complex data, and control exactly how and where their work appears on the web. A more powerful and relatively easy-to-learn solution is to use code templates built with Highcharts <https://highcharts.com>, an open-source library, which you can [modify and host on GitHub](github), as described in this book.

Tool review: 
- Pros of working with Highcharts (http://highcharts.com):
  - Open-source code that is free for individuals, schools, and non-profits to use online or download
  - Easier for beginners to understand than more complex visualization code libraries
- Cons:
  - For commercial use, you must purchase a license http://www.highcharts.com/products/highcharts
  - Must host your own code repositories to publish to the web (with a free service such as GitHub Pages)

#### Inside Highcharts code templates {-}
The templates featured above vary from simple to complex, but all of them include three basic types of code:
- HTML: to structure content on the web (example: index.html)
- CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet: to shape how content appears on the web (example: style.css)
- JavaScript: to create the chart and interactivity (example: script.js)

Also, these templates refer to other code elements:
- library: link to online instructions to complete routine tasks (example: Highcharts)
- data: content to appear in chart, typically in CSV format (example: data.csv) or pulled from Google Sheets
