Let's build a simple point map with sample data, using Google My Maps <https://www.google.com/maps/d/>. Requires signing up for a free Google Drive account.

1) Click this link and Save to download to your computer: [sample-address-data in CSV format](data/sample-address-data.csv). CSV means comma-separated values, a generic spreadsheet format that most tools can easily open. For help with downloading, see this [short video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-04PQldP9HQ).

2) Open and sign in to Google My Maps https://www.google.com/maps/d/

3) Click the red + symbol to create a new map, which will be saved automatically to your Google Drive folder.

6) Choose a column to title your markers. Select "Description" for this sample data, then Finish.

8) To style the map markers, click Individual Styles. In this sample data, you can select Group Places By > Style By > Group. This will color markers according to the three categories.

```{r style-markers}
if(knitr::is_html_output(excludes="markdown")) knitr::include_url("images/07-map/mymaps-style-groups-640w.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("images/placeholder.jpg")
```

9) To publish your map on the web, click Share, add a map title, change from Private to Public on the Web, so that anyone can view your map. Click Save and Done.

10) To embed the map on your own website, click the three vertical dots next to the map title for more options, and select Embed On My Site. The tool will generate an iframe code for you to copy. For next steps, go to the [Embed on Your Web](embed.html) chapters in this book.
