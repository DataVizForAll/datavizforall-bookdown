# Chart.js Code Templates {#chartjs}
TODO: Rewrite chapter

While beginners appreciate the drag-and-drop chart tools and tutorials described earlier in this book, such as [Google Sheets](google-sheets.html) and [Tableau Public](tableau-public.html), more advanced users may wish to customize their visualizations, add more complex data, and control exactly how and where their work appears on the web. A more powerful and relatively easy-to-learn solution is to use code templates built with Chart.js <https://www.chartjs.org/>, an open-source library, which you can [modify and host on GitHub](github.html), as described in this book.

#### Working with Chart.js {-}

##### Pros {-}
- Open-source code that is distributed under MIT license and is free for all and
- Easier for beginners to understand than more complex visualization code libraries such as D3.js

##### Cons
- Must host your own code repositories to publish to the web (with a free service such as GitHub Pages)

#### List of Chart.js templates

| Templates     | Best use and tutorial chapters |
| --- | --- |
| Chart.js Bar Chart<br> ![](images/09-chartjs/chartjs-bar.png) | Bar charts (vertical bar charts are often called column charts) can be used to compare categorical data. <br>Template with tutorial: [Bar Chart.js with CSV Data](chartjs-bar-csv.html) |
| Chart.js Line Chart<br> ![](images/09-chartjs/chartjs-line.png) | Line charts are normally used to show trends (temporal data). <br>Template with tutorial: [Line Chart with CSV Data](chartjs-line-csv.html) |
| Chart.js Scatter Chart<br> ![](images/09-chartjs/chartjs-scatter.png) | Scatter charts (also scatterplots) are used to display data of 2 or more dimensions. <br>Template with tutorial: [Scatter Chart with CSV Data](chartjs-scatter-csv.html) |
| Chart.js Bubble Chart<br> ![](images/09-chartjs/chartjs-bubble.png) | Bubble charts are used to display data of 3 or more dimensions. <br>Template with tutorial: [Bubbble Chart with CSV Data](chartjs-bubble-csv.html) |

#### Inside the templates {-}
The templates featured above vary from simple to complex, but all of them rely on four basic pillars:

  * HTML: language to structure content on the web (example: index.html)
  * CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet: to shape how content appears on the web (example: style.css)
  * JavaScript: code to create the chart and interactivity (example: script.js)
  * CSV: data that powers the visualization that is expressed in comma-separated format (example: data.csv)

Also, these templates refer to other code elements:

  * library: link to online instructions to complete routine tasks (example: Chart.js)
  * data: content to appear in chart, typically in CSV format (example: data.csv) or pulled from Google Sheets

## Bar Chart.js with CSV Data {- #chartjs-bar-csv}
Bar charts (vertical bar charts are often called *column charts*) can be used to compare categorical data. The y-axis (or x-axis for horizontal bar chart) should always start at 0.

## Line Chart.js with CSV Data {- #chartjs-line-csv}
Line charts are often used to show temporal data (trends). The x-axis often represents time intervals. Unlike column or bar charts, y-axes of line charts do not necessarily start at 0.

## Scatter Chart.js with CSV Data {- #chartjs-scatter-csv}
Scatter charts (also *scatterplots*) are used to display data of 2 or more dimensions. The scatter chart below shows the relationship between household income and test performance for school districts in Connecticut. Using x- and y-axes to show two dimensions, it is easy to see that test performance improves as household income goes up.

#### Going beyond two dimensions {-}
To show more than two dimensions in scatter charts, one can:

* **color** each data point differently to show third dimension, eg use shades of red and green to show 5-year trend in test performance;
* **resize** each data point to display fourth dimension, eg number of students in each school district;
* use different **icons or glyphs** to display fifth dimension, eg circles for male students and squares for female students.

Remember not to overwhelm the viewer and communicate only the data that are necessary to prove or illustrate your idea.

## Bubble Chart.js with CSV Data {- #chartjs-bubble-csv}
Bubble charts are similar to [scatter plots](chartjs-scatter-csv.html). The size of each dot (marker) is used to represent an additional dimension.

In the demo below, the bubble chart shows the relationship between median household income (x-axis) and test performance (y-axis) in 6 school districts in Connecticut. The size of data point (marker) corresponds to the number of students enrolled in the school district: bigger circles represent larger school districts.

#### Tip: Use semi-transparent circles {-}
Data points may obstruct each other. To avoid this, play with color transparency. For example, `rgba(160, 0, 0, 0.5)` is a semi-transparent red in RGBA color model. The `a` stands for `alpha`, and is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 is solid, and 0 is completely transparent. Using transparency, you will be able to see data points that are hidden behind bigger neighbors.

#### Going beyond three dimensions {-}
To show more than three dimensions in bubble charts, one can:

* **color** each data point differently to show fourth dimension, eg use shades of red and green to show 5-year trend in test performance;
* use different **icons or glyphs** to display fifth dimension, eg circles for male students and squares for female students.

Remember not to overwhelm the viewer and communicate only the data that are necessary to prove or illustrate your idea.
