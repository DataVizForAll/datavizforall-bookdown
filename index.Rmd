Tell your story and show it with data, using free and easy-to-learn tools on the web. This introductory book teaches you how to design interactive charts and customized maps for your website, beginning with easy drag-and-drop tools, such as Google Sheets, Datawrapper, and Tableau Public. You'll also gradually learn how to edit open-source code templates like Chart.js, Highcharts, and Leaflet on GitHub. Follow along with the step-by-step tutorials, real-world examples, and online resources. This book is ideal for students, educators, community activists, non-profit organizations, small business owners, local governments, journalists, researchers, or anyone who wants to tell their story and show the data. No coding experience is required.

## Audience and Overview {- #audience-overview}
We designed this introductory guide to be broadly accessible for newcomers, and to offer an educational resource for advanced users who teach or guide others in the field of data visualization. It began as a textbook for an introductory course for college students and their community partners in Hartford, Connecticut, who collaborated to create interactive charts and maps to tell their organization's data story on the web in 2016. A year later, readership expanded when over five thousand students around the globe enrolled in a free online edX course, based on an earlier draft of this book.^[@doughertyToughQuestionsAsk2017] Guided by feedback from readers and other educators, we significantly overhauled the structure, deepened the conceptual material, and added more tutorials with enhanced visuals.

TODO: who this book is for... spreadsheets to code... if you   not just one tool, but several tools, all of them free and easy-to-learn, along with our guidance on how to choose tools....

Learn by following the step-by-step tutorials on a laptop or desktop computer with an internet connection. We recommend any computer running either the Macintosh or Windows operating system, with a modern web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Another good option is a Chromebook or Linux computer, which allows you to complete *most* of the tutorials in this book, and we'll point out any limitations in specific chapters. While it may be possible to complete some tutorials on a tablet or smartphone device, we do not recommend it because you cannot follow all of the steps.

If you're working on a laptop, consider buying or borrowing an external mouse that plugs into your computer. We've met several people who find it much easier to click, hover, and scroll with an external mouse than a laptop's built-in trackpad. If you're new to working with computers--or teaching newer users with this book---consider starting with [basic computer and mouse tutorial skills from the Goodwill Community Foundation](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/subjects/basic-skills/). Also, if you're reading a digital version of this book on a laptop, consider connecting a second computer monitor, or working with a tablet or second computer alongside you. This allows you to read the book in one screen and build data visualizations in the other screen.

| ![](images/0-preface/dougherty-jack.jpg) | Jack Dougherty is Professor of Educational Studies at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He teaches a data visualization course where students partner with community organizations to help them tell their stories online with interactive charts and maps. Trained as a historian, Jack learned data visualization to share evidence more widely about cities, suburbs, and schools over time for his *[On The Line](https://ontheline.trincoll.edu)* book.

We originally launched an earlier draft of this book under a different title, *Data Visualization For All*, to accompany a [free online edX course](https://www.edx.org/course/data-visualization-for-all) by the same name, sponsored by Trinity College. Co-instructors Stacy Lam (Trinity Class of 2019) and David Tatem (Instructional Technologist) contributed valuable ideas and energy as we created content for that course in Spring 2017, which to date has enrolled over 23,000 students, though [only a fraction actually complete the 6-week curriculum](https://jackdougherty.org/2017/11/21/tough-questions-to-ask-about-trinity-edx/). Thanks also to the Trinity Information Technology staff and friends who produced the edX course videos: Angie Wolf, Sean Donnelly, Ron Perkins, Samuel Oyebefun, Phil Duffy, and Christopher Brown. Also, Veronica X. Armendariz (Trinity Class of 2016) made valuable contributions to the early version of the book while serving as a teaching assistant for the [Data Visualization internship seminar](http://commons.trincoll.edu/dataviz/) that brought together Trinity undergraduates and Hartford community partners. Funding for students who worked on the earlier draft was generously provided by the [Office of Community Learning](https://cher.trincoll.edu/community-learning/) and [Information Technology Services](https://www.trincoll.edu/LITC/its/) at Trinity College.

Thanks to many individuals and organizations who helped us to learn many of the skills that we teach in this book, especially Alvin Chang and Andrew Ba Tran, who previously were data journalists at *The Connecticut Mirror*; and Michael Howser, Steve Batt, and their colleagues at the University of Connecticut Libraries Map and Geographic Information Center (MAGIC). Also, many people inspired us to be *code-curious* at The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp) events, sponsored by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, and engaged us with civic technology for the public good at Transparency Camp events sponsored by the Sunlight Foundation. We also appreciate Scott Gaul for inviting us to share our work-in-progress at Hartford data workshops and discussions, sponsored by the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving.

We thank everyone at O'Reilly Media who worked with us to bring you this book, especially our outstanding developmental editor, Amelia Blevins, and other members of the team: Nick Adams, Jonathan Hassel, Andy Kwan, Katie Tozer,... We also thank O'Reilly's support for technical reviewers whose valuable feedback helped us to improve the manuscript, including Carl Allchin, Derek Eder, Erica Hayes, etc...., and additional readers, including Gared Bard, Nick Klagge....
