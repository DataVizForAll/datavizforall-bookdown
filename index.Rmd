Tell your story and show it with data, using free and easy-to-learn tools on the web. This introductory book teaches you how to design interactive charts and customized maps for your website, beginning with easy drag-and-drop tools, such as Google Sheets, Datawrapper, and Tableau Public. You'll also gradually learn how to edit open-source code templates like Chart.js, Highcharts, and Leaflet on GitHub. Follow along with the step-by-step tutorials, real-world examples, and online resources. This book is ideal for students, educators, community activists, non-profit organizations, small business owners, local governments, journalists, researchers, or anyone who wants to tell their story and show the data. No coding experience is required.

## Audience and Overview {- #audience-overview}
As educators, we designed this book to be accessible for new learners, to introduce key concepts in data visualization and reinforce them with hands-on examples. We assume no prior knowledge other than a basic familiarity with computers and some vague memories of secondary school mathematics. Based on feedback we've received from an earlier draft, many readers across the globe have taught themselves with this book, and others educators are already using it as a textbook to teach their students.

Our subtitle, "Interactive Storytelling from Spreadsheets to Code," reflects how the scope of the book progresses from strengthening basic skills to editing open-source code templates, while continually maintaining our focus on telling true and meaningful data stories. We explain both the *why* and the *how* of visualization, and encourage critical thinking about how data is socially constructed, and whose interests are served or ignored.

Unlike many computer books that focus on selling you a specific software application, this book introduces you to over twenty different visualization tools, all of them free and easy-to-learn. We also offer guiding principles on how to make wise choices among digital tools as they continue to evolve in the future. By working through the sample datasets and tutorials, readers will create more than a dozen different interactive charts, maps, and tables, and share these data stories with other readers on the public web.

Although our introductory book is comprehensive, we do not address certain advanced topics. For example, while we discuss ways to make meaningful data comparisons, we do not delve into the field of statistical data analysis. Also, we focus primarily on software tools with a friendly graphical user interface, rather than those that require you to memorize and enter command-line instructions, such as the powerful [R statistics packages](https://www.r-project.org). Finally, while we teach readers how to modify HTML-CSS-JavaScript code templates with the Leaflet, Chart.js, and Highcharts libraries, we do not explore more advanced visualization code libraries such as [D3](https://d3js.org). Nevertheless, we believe that nearly everyone who reads this book will discover something new and valuable.

### Advice for Hands-On Learning {-}

Learn by following the step-by-step tutorials on a laptop or desktop computer with an internet connection. We recommend any computer running either the Macintosh or Windows operating system, with a modern web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Another good option is a Chromebook or Linux computer, which allows you to complete *most* of the tutorials in this book, and we'll point out any limitations in specific chapters. While it may be possible to complete some tutorials on a tablet or smartphone device, we do not recommend it because you cannot follow all of the steps.

If you're working on a laptop, consider buying or borrowing an external mouse that plugs into your computer. We've met several people who find it much easier to click, hover, and scroll with an external mouse than a laptop's built-in trackpad. If you're new to working with computers--or teaching newer users with this book---consider starting with [basic computer and mouse tutorial skills from the Goodwill Community Foundation](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/subjects/basic-skills/). Also, if you're reading a digital version of this book on a laptop, consider connecting a second computer monitor, or working with a tablet or second computer alongside you. This allows you to read the book in one screen and build data visualizations in the other screen.

| ![](images/0-preface/dougherty-jack-200.jpg) | Jack Dougherty is Professor of Educational Studies at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He teaches a data visualization course where students partner with community organizations to help them tell their stories online with interactive charts and maps. Trained as a historian, Jack learned data visualization to share evidence more widely about cities, suburbs, and schools over time for his *[On The Line](https://ontheline.trincoll.edu)* book.

At Trinity College he completed his bachelor’s degree with a double major in Computer Science and Studio Arts, and is currently pursuing a master’s degree in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) at the University of Leeds (UK). Ilya also heads [Picturedigits](https://picturedigits.com), a design and technology lab that assists clients in analyzing and visualizing data.

### Acknowledgements {-}
In 2016 we launched an earlier draft of this book under a different title, *Data Visualization For All*, as part of an introductory course for Trinity College students and their community partners in Hartford, Connecticut to tell their organization's data stories through interactive charts and maps. Veronica X. Armendariz (Trinity Class of 2016) served as an outstanding teaching assistant and provided initial tutorials. The draft expanded in 2017 when we launched a [free online Trinity edX course](https://www.edx.org/course/data-visualization-for-all) by the same name, with our wonderful co-instructors Stacy Lam (Trinity Class of 2019) and David Tatem (Instructional Technologist), who contributed rich ideas and countless hours. To date over 23,000 students have started the edX course, though [only a small fraction actually complete the six-week curriculum](https://jackdougherty.org/2017/11/21/tough-questions-to-ask-about-trinity-edx/). Thanks also to the Trinity Information Technology staff and friends who produced edX course videos: Angie Wolf, Sean Donnelly, Ron Perkins, Samuel Oyebefun, Phil Duffy, and Christopher Brown. Funding for students who worked on the earlier draft was generously provided by the Office of Community Learning and Information Technology Services at Trinity College.

We thank many individuals and organizations who helped us to learn many of the skills that we teach in this book, especially Alvin Chang and Andrew Ba Tran, who previously were data journalists at *The Connecticut Mirror*; and Michael Howser, Steve Batt, and their colleagues at the University of Connecticut Libraries Map and Geographic Information Center (MAGIC). Also, thanks to everyone who inspired us to be *code-curious* at The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp) events, sponsored by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, and engaged us with civic technology for the public good at Transparency Camp events sponsored by the Sunlight Foundation. We also appreciated opportunities to share our work-in-progress at data workshops hosted by Scott Gaul and Doug Shipman, formerly at the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, and Michelle Riordan-Nold at the Connecticut Data Collaborative.

Guided by feedback from readers, educators, and our editors, we rewrote the entire draft in 2020 to reorganize the structure, deepen the concepts, and enhance the tutorials. We thank everyone at O'Reilly Media who worked with us to bring you this finish produced, especially our outstanding developmental editor, Amelia Blevins, and other members of her team: Nick Adams, Jonathan Hassel, Andy Kwan, and Katie Tozer. We also appreciate O'Reilly's support for three technical reviewers who provided excellent feedback on the manuscript: Carl Allchin, Derek Eder, and Erica Hayes. Thanks also to readers whose comments helped us to improve the text: Gared Bard and Nick Klagge.
