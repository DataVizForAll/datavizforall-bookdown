We originally launched an earlier draft of this book under a different title, *Data Visualization For All*, to accompany a [free online edX course](https://www.edx.org/course/data-visualization-for-all) by the same name, sponsored by Trinity College. Co-instructors Stacy Lam (Trinity Class of 2019) and David Tatem (Instructional Technologist) contributed valuable ideas and energy as we created content for that course in Spring 2017, which to date has enrolled over 23,000 students, though [only a fraction actually complete the 6-week curriculum](https://jackdougherty.org/2017/11/21/tough-questions-to-ask-about-trinity-edx/). Thanks also to the Trinity Information Technology staff and friends who produced the edX course videos: Angie Wolf, Sean Donnelly, Ron Perkins, Samuel Oyebefun, Phil Duffy, and Christopher Brown. Also, Veronica X. Armendariz (Trinity Class of 2016) made valuable contributions to the early version of the book while serving as a teaching assistant for the [Data Visualization internship seminar](http://commons.trincoll.edu/dataviz/) that brought together Trinity undergraduates and Hartford community partners. Funding for students who worked on the earlier draft was generously provided by the [Office of Community Learning](https://cher.trincoll.edu/community-learning/) and [Information Technology Services](https://www.trincoll.edu/LITC/its/) at Trinity College.

Thanks to many individuals and organizations who helped us to learn many of the skills that we teach in this book, especially Alvin Chang and Andrew Ba Tran, who previously were data journalists at *The Connecticut Mirror*; and Michael Howser, Steve Batt, and their colleagues at the University of Connecticut Libraries Map and Geographic Information Center (MAGIC). Also, many people inspired us to be *code-curious* at The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp) events, sponsored by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, and engaged us with civic technology for the public good at Transparency Camp events sponsored by the Sunlight Foundation. We also appreciate Scott Gaul for inviting us to share our work-in-progress at Hartford data workshops and discussions, sponsored by the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving.

We thank everyone at O'Reilly Media who worked with us to bring you this book, especially our outstanding developmental editor, Amelia Blevins, and other members of the team: Nick Adams, Jonathan Hassel, Andy Kwan, Katie Tozer,... We also thank O'Reilly's support for technical reviewers whose valuable feedback helped us to improve the manuscript, including Carl Allchin, Derek Eder, Erica Hayes, etc...., and additional readers, including Gared Bard....
