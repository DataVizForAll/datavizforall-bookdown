# Fix Common Problems {#fix}
When creating data visualizations with online tools, public datasets, and code templates, it's not uncommon to encounter some occasional problems that prevent it from working as expected. We understand that finding the source of a problem can feel frustrating. But figuring out why it broke---and how to fix it---can be a great way to learn what's happening behind the scenes. Review these sections below to help you diagnose what type of problem you may be facing, and see our recommended solutions for the most common issues we've seen. Remember that some of the thorniest problems may be caused by two or more separate issues.

## Tool or platform problems {#fix-tool}

If you have a problem with one of our recommended digital tools, and have not found the answer in this book, go to the tool's support page (listed in alphabetical order):

- [Airtable relational database support](https://support.airtable.com)
- [Atom text editor documentation](https://atom.io/docs)
- [Chart.js code library documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- [Datawrapper Academy support](https://academy.datawrapper.de/)
- [GeoJson.io geodata editor - see Help menu](http://geojson.io/)
- [GitHub.com and GitHub Desktop documentation](https://docs.github.com)
- [Google My Maps support](https://support.google.com/mymaps)
- [Google Sheets support](https://support.google.com/docs)
- [Highcharts code library - demo and support](https://www.highcharts.com)
- [Leaflet map code library - tutorials and documentation](https://leafletjs.com)
- [LibreOffice Calc support](https://help.libreoffice.org)
- [Mapshaper geodata editor - documentation wiki](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki)
- [MapWarper georectifier help](https://mapwarper.net/help) and [see note about limited disk space](https://mapwarper.net)
- [OpenRefine data cleaner - documentation](https://openrefine.org)
- [Tabula PDF table extractor - how to use](https://tabula.technology)
- [Tableau Public resources page](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources).

Of course, if you encounter a problem when using an online tool or web platform, always check your internet connection. On rare occasions, online tools and platforms may be off-line for all users. To clarify if an online service down for everyone, and not just you, check for outage reports on sites such as:

- [Downdetector.com](https://downdetector.com)
- [Down for Everyone or Just Me?](https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com)

Also, some online services operate their own status pages:

- [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com)
- [Google Workspace Status](https://www.google.com/appsstatus)

Finally, note that rare outages by large providers, such as the [problems faced by Amazon Web Services in November 2020](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/amazon-web-services-outage-stymies-businesses/2020/11/25/b54a6106-2f4f-11eb-860d-f7999599cbc2_story.html), can affect other online tool platforms.

## Try a different browser {#fix-browser}

Many problems we encounter with online tools and code templates turn out to be caused by our browser, not the tool or template itself. The *most important advice* we offer in this chapter is to *always try a different browser* to diagnose your problems. If you normally do all of your work in your favorite browser---such as [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), or [Safari for Mac only](https://www.apple.com/safari/)---download a second browser for testing purposes. But please stop using the defunct Internet Explorer or Edge Legacy browsers, since [Microsoft announced in 2020](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge) that neither will be supported in the future.

In fact, you should *always* test your data visualization products in a second browser, where you are *not* logged in to an online account for the tool or service that created it, to check how it appears to regular users. On our computers, we installed a second browser, specifically for testing, and changed the settings to *Never Remember browsing history* so that it acts like a first-time user whenever we open it.

If you encounter any issues when using your favorite browser with digital tools or web services, give it a "hard refresh" to [bypass any saved content in your cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache) and re-download the entire web page from the server, using one of these key combinations:

- Ctrl + F5 (most Windows or Linux browsers)
- Shift + Ctrl + R (Chromebook)
- Command + Shift + R (Chrome or Firefox for Mac)
- Option + Command + R (Safari for Mac)

## Diagnose with developer tools {#fix-developer-tools}

We recommend learning how to use your browser to diagnose other types of issues discussed later in this chapter, such as [problems with iframes](fix-embed.html) or [code templates](fix-code.html). Most browsers contain *developer tools* that allow you to view the source code of a web page and spot any errors that it flags. Even if you're not a software developer, learning how to open your browser's developer tools allows you to peek under the hood and make a more informed guess about what's not working. To open developer tools in various browsers:

- In Chrome, go to *View > Developer > Developer Tools*.
- In Firefox, go to *Tools > Web Developer > Toggle Tools*.
- In Microsoft Edge, go to *Settings and more (...) icon > More Tools > Developer Tools*.
- In Safari for Mac, first go to *Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Show Develop menu in menu bar*, then go to *Develop > Show JavaScript Console*.

When you open the browser's developer tools, it displays a *console* window that shows error messages that may help to diagnose problems, particularly with code templates. For example, in Chapter 10, you learned how to [edit the simple Leaflet map template in GitHub](copy-leaflet.html). If you accidentally make a mistake, such as deleting the comma between the latitude and longitude coordinates for map center, your code will "break" and display an empty gray box in your screen. If you turn on the browser developer tools, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:firefox-dev-tools), the console will display several errors, including one that points you to a problem beginning in the `index.html` file on line 29. While the error does not specifically state that a comma is missing in line 30, it's still the best clue to alert you to a problem in that vicinity of the code. This is just one way to use the developer tools, so explore other features to learn more about its many features, and how they differ across browsers.

(ref:firefox-dev-tools) When you open a browser's developer tools, the console window will display any errors it flags in the code for that web page. In this example, a "broken" map appears as a gray box (top), and the console shows an error in line 29 of the `index.html` file (middle), which offers a clue about a missing comma between the latitude and longitude coordinates in line 30 (bottom).

```{r firefox-dev-tools, out.width=500, fig.cap="(ref:firefox-dev-tools)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/17-fix/firefox-dev-tools-annotated.png")
```

## Mac or Chromebook problems {#fix-computer}

If you are using a Mac computer, make sure your settings make visible the filename extensions, meaning the abbreviated file format that appears after the period, such as `data.csv` or `map.geojson`. The Mac operating system hides these extensions by default, and several tools in this book will not work properly if are not visible. Make them visible on a Mac by going to *Finder > Preferences > Advanced*, and check the box to *Show all filename extensions*, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mac-file-extensions2).

(ref:mac-file-extensions2) On a Mac, go to *Finder - Preferences - Advanced* and check the box to *Show all filename extensions*.

```{r mac-file-extensions2, out.width=400, fig.cap="(ref:mac-file-extensions2)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/17-fix/mac-file-extensions.png")
```

If you are using a Chromebook computer, beware that it may be difficult or impossible to install and run some of the recommended tools in this book. Tools that are *not* currently supported for Chromebook include most downloadable desktop applications, such as: Atom editor, GitHub Desktop, LibreOffice Calc, OpenRefine data cleaner, Tableau Public, and Tabula PDF table extractor. But Chromebooks can still operate most of the tools that run through the Chrome browser, such as: Google Sheets, Google My Maps, Datawrapper, the GitHub.com web interface, and several others. Also, if you wish to edit code templates on a Chromebook, see the open-source [Caret text editor for Chrome](https://thomaswilburn.net/caret/) by Thomas Wilburn.

## Watch out for bad data {#fix-data}

Sometimes a problem with a data visualization tool or service is caused by bad data. Learn how to [Recognize Bad Data in Chapter 4](bad-data.html), and different ways to [Clean Data in Chapter 5](clean.html). In addition, avoid common mistakes that will introduce errors into your data files.

First, avoid typing blank spaces into spreadsheet entries---especially column headers---as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:header-blank). Although blank spaces may seem innocent to human eyes, they may confuse digital tools and code templates that expect to find column headers spelled precisely as promised, without extra spaces.

(ref:header-blank) Avoid typing blank spaces into spreadsheets, especially column headers.

```{r header-blank, out.width=300, fig.cap="(ref:header-blank)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/17-fix/header-blank.png")
```

Second, do not change names of column headers in code templates, unless you know exactly what you are doing. For example, in the Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets code template in Chapter 13, do not change the names at the top of each column, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:header-name), because the code template looks for these exact names in order to process your data.

(ref:header-name) Do not change header names in code templates.

```{r header-name, out.width=600, fig.cap="(ref:header-name)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/17-fix/header-name-annotated.png")
```

Finally, when working with Leaflet code templates that call GeoJSON data files, as described in Chapter 13, watch out for null (empty) field errors in your geodata. In the browser console diagnostic window described in the section above, these may show a `NaN` error message similar to this:

`Uncaught Error: Invalid LatLng object: (NaN, NaN)`

To resolve a `NaN` error in the browser console, use the [GeoJson.io tool in Chapter 14](geojsonio.html) to closely inspect your geodata for null fields.


## Common iframe errors {#fix-iframe}

If you followed steps in [Chapter 10: Embed on the Web](embed.html) and the contents of your iframe still do not appear in your browser, check for these common problems:

- Items listed in your iframe (such as the URL, width, or height) should be enclosed inside straight single-quote (`'`, also known as an *apostrophe*) or double-quote marks (`"`, also known as *quotation marks*). Choose either type, but be consistent.

- Always use *straight* quote marks, and avoid accidentally entering *curly quotes* (also known as *smart quotes* or *slanted quotes*), which sometimes happens when pasting code from word-processor tools.

- Always use `https` (the extra 's' means 'secure'), not `http` in iframes. Some web browsers will block content if it mixes *https* and *http* resources. All of the code templates in this book require *https*.

Use the [W3Schools TryIt iframe page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe) to test your iframe embed codes, especially when you need to edit them, since it's a great way to check for mistaken punctuation. FIG TODO shows three common problems in a simple iframe: a curly double-quote (after `src=`), use of `http` instead of `https`, and mixture of double-quotes and single-quotes. All of these problems are corrected in FIG TODO, which causes the iframe to appear as expected.

(ref:iframe-incorrect) Can you spot three common problems in the iframe code?

```{r header-name, fig.cap="(ref:header-name)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/17-fix/header-name-annotated.png")
```

(ref:iframe-correct) All three problems are corrected here, which causes the iframe to appear as expected.

```{r header-name, fig.cap="(ref:header-name)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/17-fix/header-name-annotated.png")
```

## Fix your code on GitHub {#fix-code}

As we discussed in [Chapter 11: Edit and Host Code with GitHub](github.html), working with open-source code templates gives you more control over how your data visualization appears and where it is hosted online. But it also means that when your code breaks, you're also responsible for fixing it, or finding a qualified person to help you fix it, perhaps for a fee. If you encounter problems with fixing your code or hosting it on the free GitHub platform, review the relevant chapter(s) in this book and watch out for common problems listed below.

- Be careful when editing your code. A single typo---such as a missing comma, semicolon, or quotation mark, or parenthesis---can break your visualization. We understand how frustrated you may feel when this happens, because it's also happened to us, so take a short break and come back to your screen a bit later, with fresh eyes to help you find the problem.

- Be patient. If edits to your visualization do *not* appear right away on GitHub Pages, wait up to 60 seconds (perhaps longer during busy periods) for the online platform to finish processing your edits. Then give your browser a "hard refresh" to [bypass any saved content in your cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache) and re-download the entire web page from the server, using one of these key combinations:

  - Ctrl + F5 (most Windows or Linux browsers)
  - Shift + Ctrl + R (Chromebook)
  - Command + Shift + R (Chrome or Firefox for Mac)
  - Option + Command + R (Safari for Mac)

- Always test the link to your published visualization in a *different* browser. Sometimes problems are actually caused by a glitch in the browser, not the code itself.

- On occasion, the GitHub platform may experience an outage or report known problems with building GitHub Pages from your code. Check the [GitHub Status site](https://status.github.com).

Over time, code templates require maintenance to ensure that they will continue to work as technology evolves. For example, the code templates featured in this book all have *code dependencies*, which means they rely on other code or online services in order to operate. These dependencies include online code libraries that create charts and maps, such as Chart.js, Highcharts, Leaflet, and others. Also, map code templates depend on online map tiles from providers such as CARTO, Stamen, and OpenStreetMap. *If one of your online code dependencies is no longer operating*, your code template will stop working.

- To check if your code template has a problem with one of its online code dependencies, go back to the original GitHub repository where you made your copy. Check to see if the current demo version is still running online. If yes, then check to see if the original GitHub repo has had recent code updates that may solve your problem. Some code updates are very simple and can be typed directly into your repo through the GitHub web interface. But other code updates are more complex, so review how to "pull" code from a repo to your local computer using tools such as [GitHub Desktop in Chapter 11](github-desktop-atom.html).

- If the original GitHub repo from which you copied the code template does not have an online demo version that is properly functioning, contact the open-source software developer. On GitHub, the best way to do this is to create an *Issue* in the web interface. However, there is no guarantee that an open-source software developer will continue to maintain her code project in the future.

- Another advantage of using GitHub Desktop is that you can *revert* a code commit you previously made, and go back to a prior version of the code as it existed on a certain date. Currently, there is no easy way to revert back to a prior version of the code solely through the GitHub web interface, but you *can download* a prior version of the code to your local computer.

Problems with Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets template ....

- Do NOT rename column headers (in row 1) of any sheet, because the Leaflet Map code looks for these exact words.

- In your Points tab, DO NOT leave any blank rows

Warning: Media file pathnames are case-sensitive, and we recommend using *all lowercase characters*, including the suffix ending. Also, since the code template automatically resizes images to fit, we recommend that you *reduce the size* of any images to 600x400 pixels or less prior to uploading, to make sure your map operates smoothly.






To fully view more complex code templates in your local browser, including some [Chart.js or Highcharts templates in Chapter 12](chartcode.html) or [Leaflet templates in Chapter 13](leaflet.html), you may need to temporarily relax [same-origin policy restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy), an internet security mechanism that limits how web pages access content from other domains. You can do so by managing your [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)(CORS) settings, and methods for doing this vary across operating systems and browsers. For example, [to disable same-origin policy on Safari for Mac](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4556429/disabling-same-origin-policy-in-safari), first go to *Preferences > Advanced* to enable the *Developer* menu, then in this new menu select *Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions*. After you are done testing your code, restart Safari to reset the setting to its default safety position. See also ways to [run the Chrome browser without same-origin restrictions on various computers](https://alfilatov.com/posts/run-chrome-without-cors/) or this [popular Stackoverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome). If you temporarily disable this safety mechanism in your browser, be sure to re-enable it before browsing sites on the public web.

If you decide to safely delete one of your GitHub repositories and start over with a code template, here's a simple way to save your work:

4) If you cannot find the problem, go to the top of this page to Safely Delete Your GitHub Repo and Start Over. Also, make a new copy of the Google Sheet template, give it a new name, and copy data from your old sheet using File > Paste Special > Values Only.

- Go to the top-level of your GitHub repository, similar to `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY`
- Click the green "Clone or Download" button, and select Download Zip to receive a compressed folder of your repo contents on your computer.
- In your GitHub repo, click on Settings (upper-right area) and scroll down to Delete This Repository.
- To prevent accidental deletions, GitHub requires you to type in the REPOSITORY name.
- Now you can start over in one of these ways:
  - If you wish to [Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages](github-pages.html), follow that tutorial again.
  - OR
  - Fork another copy of the original GitHub repository to your account. After you create your copy, if you wish to add selected files that you previously downloaded to your computer, follow directions to [Upload Code with GitHub](create-repo) in the second half of this tutorial in this book

## Where to ask questions {#fix-questions}

(describe your problem, computer OS and browser version, and what you have tried so far, and add a screenshot or link to your open-source code when appropriate)
