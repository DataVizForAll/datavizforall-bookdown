## Sketch Your Data Story {- #sketch}

Before you dive deeply into software, think about the most important item in your toolkit: *your story*. The primary reason we're designing visualizations is to improve how we communicate our data story to other people, so let's begin there.

Push away the computer and pick up some old-school tools:

  - colored markers or pencils
  - lots of blank paper
  - your imagination

First, at the top of the page, write down your data story.

- Is it in the form of a question? If so, figure out how to pose the question. [Use some of this from ch 3? -- Start the process by writing down your question---literally in the form of a question, punctuated with a question mark---to clarify your own thinking, and also so that you can clearly communicate it to others who may be assisting you. All too often, our brains automatically jump ahead to try to identify the *answer*, without reflecting on the best way frame the *question* in a way that does not limit the range of possible results.]
- Or maybe it's in the form of an answer to that question? If so, spell out your clearest statement.
- If you're lucky, perhaps you already can envision a full story, with a beginning, middle, and end.
- Whatever form it takes in your head, write out the words that come to mind.

Further down the page (or on a separate sheet), draw quick pictures of the visualizations that comes to your mind, even if you don't yet have any data. No artistic skills are required. Just use your imagination.
- Do you envision some type of chart? Sketch a picture.
- Or do you imagine some type of map? Show what it might look like.
- Will your visualization be interactive? Insert arrows, buttons, whatever.

Finally, share your data story with someone else and talk through your preliminary ideas. Does your sketch and sentences help to convey the broader idea that you're trying to communicate? If so, this is one good sign that your data story is worth pursuing, with the visualization tools, templates, and techniques in other chapters of this book.

Now that you have a clearer idea of the data story you wish to tell, let's explore some of the free digital tools featured in this book, and questions you should ask yourself when choosing among them.

## Tools and Tradeoffs {- #tools-tradeoffs}
If you feel overwhelmed by the growing number of digital tools, you're not alone. Trying to keep track of all of the different software applications to get your regular work done sometimes feels like an additional part-time job that you didn't realize you signed up for. Digital tools are continuously evolving. That's good news if you like to choose among many options, but bad news if you don't have time to make complex decisions.

When you're comparing digital tools, every decision involves some type of tradeoff, or balancing of competing wants and needs. To help you navigate this decision-making process, here's our list of ten important factors that go through our minds when we consider using a new piece of software or online service. We worded our categories very broadly, since they can be applied to other realms of your digital world, but for each one we'll offer more context about data visualization in particular.

*1. Easy-to-learn*

How much of your time will learning a new tool require? This may be the most important factor in our busy lives, but also one that varies a great deal, as your personal investment of time and energy depends largely on your prior level of skills using similar tools, and your pace in grasping related concepts. In the next few chapters, we highlight several we label as *Easy Tools* because most novices describe them as relatively straightforward for getting started on with data visualization projects, and provide helpful error messages when things go wrong. Easier tools usually feature a graphical user interface, meaning you operate them with pull-down menus or drag-and-drop steps, rather than memorizing a set of commands to be typed into a blank box. Later in the book, we'll introduce ways to create more advanced visualizations through code templates, which you can copy and edit more easily than writing computer code from scratch. When deciding which tools to include to this book, we placed easy-to-learn at the top of our list. In fact, we removed a popular drag-and-drop tool from an earlier version of this book because it required far too many steps to create a map, and even we had trouble following our own instructions. When faced with several good options, choose simplicity.

*2. Affordable*

Is the tool entirely free to use? Or is based on a *freemium* model that offers basic features for free, with premium features at a price? Or does it require making a one-time purchase, or a monthly subscription fee? Of course, the answer to what is affordable will vary for each person. Of course, we fully understand that some software developers require user fees to stay in business, and both of us happily pay to use some specific tools in our work. If you regularly rely on a particular tool to do your job, with no viable alternative, it's in your best interest to financially support their continued existence. But when selecting tools to feature in this data visualization book, we chose those that are entirely free, or offer most of their features at the free level, to increase access for readers around the globe. We're both impressed by what newcomers to the field can accomplish with a wide array of free tools.

*3. Powerful*

Does the tool provide all of the features you anticipate needing? In the realm of data visualization, does the tool support a wide variety of chart types? More usually is better, but some types are obscure and rarely used, such as [radar charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart) and [waterfall charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_chart). Similarly, are there significant limits on the amount of data you can upload, or the products it creates? For example, once we removed a freemium tool from an earlier version of this book because the company began to require that maps viewed more than 100 times on the web require the paid license. Finally, to what extent can you customize the style or appearance of your visualizations? It's common for drag-and-drop or freemium tools to limit your display options, so you may need to make tradeoffs between easy-to-learn and affordable versus more powerful and customizable ones. In this book, we gradually introduce more advanced tools in each chapter, to help you identify tools that fit your ideal combination of simplicity and power.

*4. Supported*

Does the software developer regularly maintain and update the tool, and respond to questions or issues? Is there an active user community that supports the tool and shares their knowledge? If you've worked with digital tools as long as we have, you'll recognize our pain in losing those we regularly relied on, yet whose developers pulled the plug. For example, the [Killed By Google](http://killedbygoogle.com) lists nearly 200 applications and online services that this multi-billion dollar corporation closed down. One of these was a popular data visualization tool, [Google Fusion Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fusion_Tables), which previously occupied a full chapter in an earlier version of this book until we removed it when Google shut down the tool after a ten-year run in 2019. Although none of us can predict which online tools will persist in future years, we always look for signs of active support---such as regular updates, stars earned on a [GitHub](http://github.com) developer's site, and questions answered in the [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) user forum---when deciding which ones to feature in this book.

*5. Transferable*

How easily can you migrate your data *into* and *out* of an online platform? Even the best visualization tools do not last forever in the rapidly-evolving digital age. Eventually, all data needs to migrate to another platform, and it's your job to be prepared for this inevitable transition. For example, we stopped recommending an online story map tool by a well-known software company, because while users can upload locations, text, and photos, there is no simple way to export all of their work! One the best ways to future-proof your visualization projects is to ensure that your data files are easily separated from the presentation software that generates the charts or maps. If your current tool or online service announced it would stop working next week, could you easily extract all of the underlying data in a common file format that you can upload to a different platform? When selecting tools to highlight in this book, we favored those that supported easy data downloads for future migrations.

*6. Secure and Private*

This category combines related questions about security and privacy. First, does the online tool or service take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from malicious hackers and malware? Review a [list of data breaches on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) to help you make informed decisions. Second, if you access the tool through your browser, does it track your web activity across different sites? Consider installing the free [Privacy Badger browser extension from the Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://privacybadger.org/) to view and exercise some control over who's tracking you, and also review the [EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense Guide](https://ssd.eff.org/). Also be aware of [internet censorship by different governments around the globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country), as compiled by Wikipedia, unless you are reading this in China, which has [blocked access to all of Wikipedia since April 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Wikipedia). Finally, does the tool clearly explain whether the data you enter or the products you create will stay private or become public? For example, some companies offer free access to their visualization tools, but in exchange, require you to make your data, charts, and maps publicly accessible. That tradeoff may be acceptable if you're working with open-access data and already plan to freely share your visualizations. But make sure the terms of service are clearly defined before you start using a tool.

*7. Collaborative*

Does the tool allow people to work together and co-create a data visualization? Prior generations of digital tools were designed primarily for solo users, in part to address security and privacy issues raised above. But as co-authors, who jointly created this book and the visualizations featured in it, we favor a newer generation of tools designed for collaborative work environments.

*8. Cross-Platform*

This category refers to both creating and consuming digital content. First, does the tool work across different computer operating systems? In this book, we highlight several tools that run inside any modern web browser, which usually means they will operate on all major desktop and laptop computer platforms, such as Windows, Mac, Chromebook, and Linux. At other times, we specify that a tool will only run on specific computer operating systems, which reduces access, most often to people with lower-cost computers. Second, does the tool create visualizations that are responsive to different screen sizes? In other words, does it produce charts and maps that display acceptably on smartphones and tablet devices? In this book, we favor tools that operate across desktop/laptop computer platforms, and display content responsively on smaller devices. But we do not expect that tools are designed to create data visualizations on smaller devices.

*9. Open-Source*

Is the tool’s software code publicly viewable? Can the code be modified and redistributed, so that other developers can suggest improvements, or build new features or extensions? We recognize that many companies rely on non-public proprietary code to sell their tools at a profit, and several of those tools appear in this book. But we favor open-source code when feasible, and have been impressed with the growing number of tools offered under different types of open-source licensing arrangements by for-profit companies, non-profit organizations, and sustainable communities of volunteer developers.

*10. Accessible*

Does the tool create accessible visualizations for visually-impaired users? Although disability advocacy laws were passed decades ago, web technology is still behind and slowly catching up, especially in the field of data visualization. But when selecting tools for this book, we highlight some such as [Datawrapper, which includes a built-in check for colorblindness](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colorblind-check/), and [Highcharts, which offers some chart types designed for low-vision accessible screen readers](https://www.highcharts.com/demo/accessible-line).


That's our list of ten questions to ask yourself when considering whether to add another item to your digital toolkit. You may have others, such as...ethical business practices......

## Recommended Tools In This Book {- #recommended-tools}

TODO: Explain that we recommended the following tools because we believe they satisfy several of the criteria above, and together, they comprise a relatively "small" digital toolkit. In other words, the eleventh criteria is multi-useful: Does the tool do more than one job? Does it neatly complement others on the list?

You may have other tool recommendations...and as we stated, tools change and evolve over time. So if you'd like us to consider another tool that's not already on the list, email or tweet us... explain what your recommendation would replace in the toolkit, and how it rates better on our criteria above.

## Follow Along on a Computer {- #computer}
TODO: Blend this into the last of the "tools" mentioned above, OR place closer to the top, because everyone needs access to a computer?

To follow the steps in this book, we recommend either a desktop or laptop computer, running either the Mac or Windows or Linux operating system, with an internet connection and a modern web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Another good option is a Chromebook laptop, which enables you to complete *most* of the steps in this book, and we'll point out any limitations in specific chapters. While it's possible to use a tablet or smartphone device, we do not recommend it because you cannot follow all of the steps, and you'll also get frustrated with the small screen and perhaps throw your device (or this book) across the room, and possibly injure someone (and we will not be held responsible!)

If you're working on a laptop, consider buying or borrowing an external mouse that can plug into your machine. We've met several people who found it much easier to click, hover, and scroll with a mouse rather than a laptop's built-in trackpad.

If you're new to working with computers---or teaching new users with this book---consider starting with [mouse exercises](http://www.pbclibrary.org/mousing/mousercise.htm). All of the tools in this book assume that users already know how to click tiny buttons, hover over links, and scroll web pages, but rarely are these skills taught, and everyone needs to learn them at some point in our lives.

<!-- TODO: I added the tips above because these are huge yet surmountable obstacles for many people I've worked with, especially older generations and incarcerated people. But I'm uncertain about the link to the mouse exercises. Perhaps I should tweet at public library staff and instructors to find better beginning resources? -->
