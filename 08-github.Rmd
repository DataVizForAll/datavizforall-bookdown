# Edit and Host Code with GitHub {#github}
In the first half of this book, you created interactive charts and maps on platforms that feature drag-and-drop tools, such as Google Sheets and Tableau Public. These platforms are great for beginners, but their pre-set tools limit your options for designing and customizing your visualizations, and they also require you to depend on their web servers to host your work.

In the second half of this book, get ready to make a big leap, and we'll help you along the way. You will learn how to copy, edit, and host code templates---meaning pre-written software instructions that create data visualizations---which you can modify. With templates, you'll learn how to make simple edits to insert your data, customize its appearance, and display it on the web on a site that you control. No prior coding experience is required, but it helps if you're *code-curious* and willing to experiment with your computer.

Code templates are similar to cookbook recipes. Imagine you're in your kitchen, looking at our favorite recipe that we've publicly shared to make brownies (yum!), which begins with these three steps: `Melt butter, Add sugar, Mix in cocoa.` Recipes are templates, meaning that you can follow them precisely, or modify them to suit your tastes. Imagine that you copy our recipe (or "fork" it, as coders say) and insert a new step: `Add walnuts`. If you also publicly share your recipe, now there will be two versions of instructions, to suit both those who strongly prefer or dislike nuts in their brownies. (We do not take sides in this deeply polarizing dispute.)

Currently, the most popular cookbook among coders is [GitHub](https://github.com), with more than 40 million users and over 100 million recipes (or "code repositories" or "repos"). You can sign up for a free account and choose to make your repos private (like Grandma's secret recipes) or public (like the ones we share below). GitHub encourages sharing *open-source code*, meaning the creator grants permission for others to freely distribute and modify it, based on the conditions of the type of license they have selected. When you create a brand-new repo, GitHub invites you to [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/). Two of the most popular open-source software licenses are the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), which is very permissive, and the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/), which mandates that any modifications be shared under the same license. The latter version is often described as a *copyleft* license that requires any derivatives of the original code to remain publicly accessible, in contrast to traditional *copyright* that favors private ownership. When you fork a copy of someone's open-source code on GitHub, look at the type of license they've chosen (if any), keep it in your version, and respect its terms.

In the next section, we'll walk you through these basic GitHub steps:

- Get a free GitHub account and fork your copy of a simple Leaflet map code template
- Edit the Leaflet map title, starting position, background layer, and marker
- Host a live online version of your modified map code on the public web

Later you'll learn how to create a new GitHub repo to upload code and other types of files.

We'll introduce the basic steps of GitHub using its web browser interface, which works best for beginners. Later in this chapter you'll learn how to work more efficiently with code on your personal computer using tools such as GitHub Desktop and Atom Editor.

Finally, we'll discuss how to identify and fix common GitHub and code errors. All of us make mistakes and accidentally "break our code" from time to time, and it's a great way to learn how things work---and what to do when it doesn't work!

**TODO above:** insert cross-references to jump to sections; decide whether to convert the text description of recipes to visual images of two recipe cards, one forked from the other, with walnuts added

## Fork, Edit, and Host a Simple Leaflet Map Template {- #fork-leaflet}
Now that you understand how [GitHub](http://github.com) code repositories are like a public cookbook of recipes, which anyone can copy and modify, let's get into the kitchen and start baking! In this section, we'll introduce you to a very simple code template that creates an interactive map using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com), an open-source code library that's very popular with coders, journalists, businesses, and government agencies. Many people chose Leaflet because the code is freely available to everyone, relatively easy to use, and has an active community of supporters who regularly update it. But unlike drag-and-drop tools that we covered in previous chapters, such as Google My Maps or Tableau Public, Leaflet requires you to write (or copy and paste) several lines of code, which need to be hosted on a web server so that other people can view your map in their web browser. Fortunately, we can do all of these steps in our web browser on GitHub.

Your goal is to create your own version of this simple interactive map, with your modifications, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-simple).

(ref:leaflet-simple) Create your own version of this [simple interactive Leaflet map](https://handsondataviz.github.io/leaflet-map-simple/).

```{r leaflet-simple, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-simple)"}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("https://handsondataviz.github.io/leaflet-map-simple/") else knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-simple.png")
```

Before you begin, create your own free account on [GitHub](http://github.com). It may ask you to do a simple quiz to prove you're a human! If you don't see a confirmation message in your email, check your spam folder.

Tip: Choose a GitHub username that's relatively short, and one that you'll be happy seeing in the web address of charts and maps you'll publish online. In other words, `DrunkBrownieChef6789` may not be the wisest choice for a username, if `BrownieChef` is also available.

1. After you log into your GitHub account in your browser, go to our simple Leaflet map template at https://github.com/HandsOnDataViz/leaflet-map-simple

2. To create your own copy of our template, click the Fork button as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-simple-fork).

(ref:leaflet-simple-fork) Click the Fork button to make your own copy of the code template.

```{r leaflet-simple-fork, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-simple-fork)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-simple-fork.png")
```

When you fork someone else's repo, in the upper-right corner of your browser you should see something like `YourUserName/leaflet-map-simple` forked from `HandsOnDataViz/leaflet-map-simple`. This proves that you copied our template into your GitHub account. This very simple repo includes only three files: `LICENSE` shows that we've selected the MIT License, which allows anyone to copy and modify the code as they wish; `README.md` provides a simple description and link to the live demo, which we'll come back to later; `index.html` is the key file that contains the map code.

Tip: By design, GitHub allows you to fork a repo *one time*, so that you don't accidentally create two versions with the same name. If you wish to create a second version, go to the [Create a New Repo and Upload Files on GitHub](create-repo.html) section of this chapter.

3. Click on the `index.html` file to view the code, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-simple-index).

(ref:leaflet-simple-index) Click the Index file to view the code.

```{r leaflet-simple-index, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-simple-index)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-simple-index.png")
```

In case this is the first time you're looking at computer code, we've inserted several "code comments" to explain what's happening. The first block you see is written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) that tells web browsers the formatting to read the rest of the page of code. The second block instructs the browser to load the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) code library, the open-source software that constructs the interactive map. The third block describes where the map and title should be positioned on the screen, written in a language called Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). The good news is that you don't need to touch any of those blocks of code, so leave them as-is. But you do want to modify a few lines further below.

4. To edit the code, click on the the pencil symbol in the upper-right corner, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-simple-edit).

(ref:leaflet-simple-edit) Click the pencil button to edit the code.

```{r leaflet-simple-edit, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-simple-edit)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-simple-edit.png")
```

Let's start by making one simple change to prove to everyone that you're now editing *your* map, by modifying the map title, which appears in the HTML division tag block around lines 21-23.

5. In this line `<div id="map-title">EDIT your map title</div>`, type your new map title in place of the words `EDIT your map title`. Be careful not to erase the HTML tags which appear on both ends inside the `< >` symbols.

6. To save your edit, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the green `Commit Changes` button, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-simple-commit).

(ref:leaflet-simple-commit) Click the green Commit Changes button to save your edits.

```{r leaflet-simple-commit, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-simple-commit)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-simple-commit.png")
```

In the language of coders, we "commit" our changes in the same way that most people "save" a document, and later you'll see how GitHub tracks each code commit so that you can roll them back if needed. By default, GitHub inserts a short description of your commit as "Update index.html", and you have the option to customize that description when you start making lots of commits to keep track of your work. Also by default, GitHub commits your changes directly to the `master` branch of your code, which we'll explain later.

Now let's publish your edited map to the public web to see how it looks in a web browser. GitHub not only stores open-source code, but its built-in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature allows you to host a live online version of your HTML-based code, which anyone with the web address can view in their browser. While GitHub Pages is free to use, there are [some restrictions on size and content](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) and it is not intended for running an online business or commercial transactions. But one advantage of code templates is that you can host them on any web server you control. Since we're already using GitHub to store and edit our code template, it's easy to turn on GitHub Pages to host it online.

7. To access GitHub Pages, scroll to the top of your repo page and click the Settings button as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-simple-settings).

(ref:leaflet-simple-settings) Click the Settings button to access GitHub Pages and publish your work on the web.

```{r leaflet-simple-settings, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-simple-settings)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-simple-settings.png")
```

8. In the Settings screen, scroll down to the GitHub Pages area, and use the drop-down menu to change Source from `None` to `Master Branch`, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-github-pages). There is no *commit* or *save* button here, and the change will happen automatically. This step tells GitHub to publish a live version of your map on the public web, where anyone can access it in their browser, if they have the web address.

(ref:leaflet-github-pages) Under GitHub Pages, switch the source from None to Master as shown in this [animated GIF](https://github.com/HandsOnDataViz/book/blob/master/images/08-github/leaflet-github-pages.gif).

```{r leaflet-github-pages, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-github-pages)"}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("images/08-github/leaflet-github-pages.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-github-pages.png")
```

9. Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages area to see the web address where your live map has been published online, and right-click it to open in a new browser tab, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-github-pages2). By opening your live map in a new tab, you to easily go back to your repo in the first tab, to edit more code later.

(ref:leaflet-github-pages2) Under GitHub Pages, double-click your published map link as shown in this [animated GIF](https://github.com/HandsOnDataViz/book/blob/master/images/08-github/leaflet-github-pages2.gif).

```{r leaflet-github-pages2, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-github-pages2)"}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("images/08-github/leaflet-github-pages2.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-github-pages2.png")
```

10. Click on the new tab to view your live map, with your new title at the top. GitHub Pages automatically generates a public web address for your repo in this format, `https://YourUserName.github.io/leaflet-map-simple`, where `YourUserName` is your GitHub account username. Remember why we told you not to create your account with a username like `DrunkBrownieChef6789`?

Tip: If your map does *not* appear right away, wait up to 30 seconds for GitHub Pages to finish processing, then do a "hard" browser refresh to contact the web server again. **TODO:** Add hard refresh instructions, or link them here if shown earlier in the book.

Tip: Keep this second browser tab open, so that you can come back to your live map later, and copy its web address to use below.

Let's go back to your GitHub repo and change the links so that they point to *your* live map, in place of *our* live map.

11. Go back to the previous browser tab, and click on the repo title to return to its home page, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-click-title).

(ref:leaflet-click-title) On your first browser tab, click the repo title.

```{r leaflet-click-title, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-click-title)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-click-title.png")
```

If you can't find your first browser tab, you can retype your repo home page address in this format, and insert your GitHub username: `https://github.com/YourUserName/leaflet-map-simple`.

12. Copy the web address of your live map (in your second browser tab) and paste it into two places on your repo home page (in your first tab). First, click the `Edit` button near the top-right corner of your repo, paste your link there, and save. Second, open the `README.md` file or scroll down to the bottom of the repo home page, click the pencil symbol to edit it, paste your link under the label `(replace with link to your site)`, and scroll down to commit the change. See both steps in Figure \@ref(fig:leaflet-paste-links).

(ref:leaflet-paste-links) Paste the link to your live map at the top of your repo page, and also in your README page.

```{r leaflet-paste-links, fig.cap="(ref:leaflet-paste-links)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/leaflet-paste-links.png")
```

Pasting both of these links helps point people who discover your GitHub repo to *your* live map, rather than *our* version for this book.

Now that you've successfully made simple edits and published your live map, let's make more edits to jazz it up and help you learn more about how Leaflet code works.

13. On your repo home page, click to open the `index.html` file, and click the pencil symbol to edit more code.

Wherever you see the `EDIT` code comment, this points out a line that you can easily modify. For example, look for the code block shown below that sets up the initial center point of the map and its zoom level. Insert a new latitude and longitude coordinate to set a new center point, and find your coordinates with online tools such as [LatLong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) or Google Maps. **TODO:** Show how to find coords in GMaps here, or link if it appears earlier in the book.

```
  var map = L.map('map', {
    center: [41.77, -72.69], // EDIT latitude, longitude to re-center map
    zoom: 12,  // EDIT from 1 to 18 -- decrease to zoom out, increase to zoom in
    scrollWheelZoom: false
  });
```

The next code block displays the basemap tile layer that serve as the map background. Our template uses a light map with all labels, publicly provided by CARTO, with credit to OpenStreetMap. One simple edit is to change `light_all` to `dark_all`, which will substitute a different CARTO basemap with inverted coloring. Or see many other Leaflet basemap code options that you can paste in at https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/. Make sure to attribute the source, and also keep `}).addTo(map);` at the end of this code block, which displays the basemap.

```
 L.tileLayer('https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png', {
   attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>, &copy; <a href="https://carto.com/attribution">CARTO</a>'
 }).addTo(map);
```

The last code block displays a single point marker on the map, colored blue by default in Leaflet, with a pop-up message when users click it. You can edit the marker coordinates, insert the pop-up text, or copy and paste the code block to create a second marker.

```
L.marker([41.77, -72.69]).addTo(map) // EDIT latitude, longitude to re-position marker
.bindPopup("Insert pop-up text here"); // EDIT pop-up text message
```

14. After making edits, remember to scroll down and press the Commit button to save changes. Then go to your browser tab with the live map, and do a hard-refresh to view changes. If your map edits do not appear right away, remember that GitHub Pages sometimes requires 30 seconds to process code edits. If you have problems, see the [Fix Common GitHub and Code Errors](fix-code.html) section in this chapter.

Congratulations! If this is the first time that you've edited computer code and hosted it online, you can now call yourself a "coder". The process is similar to following and modifying a cookbook recipe, just like you also can call yourself a "chef" after baking your first batch of brownies! Although no one is likely to hire you as a full-time paid coder (or chef) at this early stage, you now understand several of the basic skills needed to copy, edit, and host code online, and you're ready to dive into the more advanced versions, such as [Chart.js code templates in chapter 9](chartjs.html) and [Leaflet map code templates in chapter 10](leaflet.html).

The next section describes how to enhance your GitHub skills by creating new repos and uploading your files. These are essential steps to create a second copy of a code template or to work with more advanced templates in the next two chapters.

## Create a New Repo and Upload Files on GitHub {- #create-repo}
Now that you've forked an existing repo on GitHub, the next step is to learn how to create a brand-new repo and upload different types of files. These skills will be helpful for several scenarios later in this book. First, since GitHub allows you to create only *one fork* of an existing repository, if you wish to make a *second* copy, you'll need to download the code and upload it into a new repo. Second, [Chapter 9 on Chart.js code templates](chartjs.html) and [chapter 10 on Leaflet map code templates](leaflet.html) allow you to upload your own files to create data visualizations, so we'll show you how GitHub has built-in support for CSV data files and GeoJSON geography files. Once again, we'll demonstrate how to do all of these steps in GitHub's beginner-level browser interface.

Let's start with GitHub's *one fork* rule. Imagine that you wish to create a second copy of the [leaflet-map-simple template](https://github.com/HandsOnDataViz/leaflet-map-simple) described in the prior section. If you attempt to create a second fork, GitHub will "gray out" the Fork button and display an error message stating that you "Cannot fork because you own this repository..." as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:repo-cannot-fork). There's a good reason for GitHub's one-fork rule: it's designed to prevent you from accidentally creating a second copy, with the same name as your first fork, which would overwrite and erase your previous work.

(ref:repo-cannot-fork) GitHub's one-fork rule prevents you from creating a second fork of a repo.

```{r repo-cannot-fork, fig.cap="(ref:repo-cannot-fork)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/repo-cannot-fork.png")
```

So how do you create a second copy of a GitHub repo? We'll show you two solutions. The first solution, if it exists in your case, is easy. Look for a green "Use this template" button in the upper-right screen, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:repo-template-download), and if you see it, click it. GitHub will ask you to create a brand-new repository name for the second copy of this template, to avoid confusing it with the first copy you made. The "Use this template" button will appear only if the people who created the GitHub repo set it up as a template, and that's exactly what we, the authors of this book, did to make it super-simple for all of you to create multiple copies of our GitHub repos.

(ref:repo-template-download) GitHub's one-fork rule prevents you from creating a second fork of a repo.

```{r repo-template-download, fig.cap="(ref:repo-template-download)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/repo-template-download.png")
```

But what if you're trying to make a second copy of a GitHub repo where the Fork button is grayed-out and there's no green "Use this template" button? The simplest solution is to follow these steps:

- Download the existing GitHub repo to your local computer
- Create a brand-new GitHub repo, with a new name
- Upload the existing code repo files to your brand-new repo

Let's try it. Imagine that you're logged into your GitHub account, and you've already created one fork of the [leaflet-map-simple](https://github.com/HandsOnDataViz/leaflet-map-simple) repo, as we did in the prior section. You wish to create a second copy, but the "Use this template" green button does not appear, either because the repo was created before that feature existed or the people who created the repo didn't set it up that way.

1. Click on the "Clone or download" gray drop-down menu button on the right-side of the screen, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:repo-template-download), and select "Download ZIP." Your browser will download a zipped compressed folder with the contents of the repo to your local computer, and it may ask you where you wish to save it. Decide on a location and click OK.

2. Navigate to the location on your computer where you saved the folder. Its file name should end with `.zip`, which means you need to double-click to "unzip" or de-compress the folder. After you do this, you should see a folder with three files: `index.html` and `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

3. Go back to your GitHub account in your web browser, click on the "+" plus symbol in the upper-right corner of your account, and select "New repository", as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:repo-create-new).

(ref:repo-create-new) Click the "+" plus symbol in upper-right corner to create a new repo.

```{r repo-create-new, fig.cap="(ref:repo-create-new)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/repo-create-new.png")
```

4. On the next screen, GitHub will ask you to assign a repo name. Choose a short one, preferably all-lower-case, and separate words with hyphens if needed. Let's name it `practice` because we'll delete it at the end of this tutorial.

Warning: Check the box to "Initialize this repository with a README" to simplify the next steps, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:repo-create-options).

All other fields are optional. Click the green "Create Repository" button at the bottom when done.

(ref:repo-create-options) Click the "+" plus symbol in upper-right corner to create a new repo.

```{r repo-create-options, fig.cap="(ref:repo-create-options)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/08-github/repo-create-options.png")
```

https://github.com/HandsOnDemo/practice


2) If you try to "fork" it again, GitHub will simply send you back to the first forked copy you already made. Clicking the "fork" button a second time is useless here.

3) Instead, go to your GitHub account and Create a New Repository. Give it a different name, and click the box to create a README.md file, then scroll down to click the Create button.

4) Go to the original repository where you wish to make a second copy, and click the Clone or Download button, and Download a zipped (compressed) file to your computer.

5) In your computer downloads folder, unzip the compressed file, typically by double-clicking it.

6) Go to the top level of your brand-new GitHub repository, and click the Upload Files button. Drag-and-drop all of the contents of the code repo you downloaded, EXCEPT the README.md file, because you have already created a new one. Click the Commit Changes button and be patient. During busy periods, a large upload may take 1 minute or more for GitHub to process.

7) When the upload is done, inspect the contents that you copied into your brand-new repository. To publish your new repo to the live web, go to Settings > GitHub Pages > select Master branch > Save. Then copy the link to your published live site and paste into your README.md file for future reference. If you need to review these last steps, see Part B: Publish section of the [Fork and Edit a Leaflet Map](fork-leaflet.html) chapter in this book.






## Work more efficiently with Atom editor and GitHub Desktop {- #atom-desktop}
TODO: REVISE outdated page: While you can do **nearly** everything in this book with GitHub in your browser, several steps will be faster and more efficient with two related free tools:

- download Atom Editor from GitHub (https://atom.io)
- download GitHub Desktop for Mac or Windows (https://desktop.github.com)

TODO: also mention GitHub features that allow collaboration, such as branches and pull requests

**UPDATE OLD INSTRUCTIONS**

Download the free GitHub Desktop tool to sync and  additional GitHub repos on your local Mac or Windows computer.
GitHub allows users to create one fork of the basic Searchable Map template repository. To create a second template, or to move and edit multiple files for more advanced versions, download the GitHub for Mac/Windows tool.
1. Download the free tool: [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
1. In the Searchable Map Template in GitHub, click __Clone__ and save to your hard drive
1. In your GitHub browser, create a new repository for your second template, and select options to create a README.MD and license (recommended: MIT).
1. Clone your second template repository to your hard drive
1. In your hard drive, copy and paste the files from the cloned Searchable Map Template to your cloned second template. Replace the existing README.MD and license files.
1. In your GitHub for Mac/Windows tool, __Commit and Sync__ your second template to your GitHub online account. Title the commit before clicking the button.
1. Refresh your browser to view the synced files in your GitHub account. Start at the top of these directions to remove an old gh-pages branch, create a new gh-pages branch, and edit files.

## Fix Common GitHub and Code Errors {- #fix-code}
What happens if you cannot view your published GitHub repository, or if your code breaks and no longer displays what it was designed to show? These are common problems, especially for newer students, because accidentally clicking the wrong box or mistakenly erasing a single character (such as a semicolon) can make your visualization seem to vanish, even though your work is usually still there. Breaking your code---and figuring out how to fix it---is a great way to learn, even if it requires trial and error.

TODO: Test one way to fix GitHub errors by going into the commits and going back to a previous version of the code. Is this possible in the web version?

#### Safely Delete your GitHub Repo and Start Over {-}
If you need to delete your GitHub repo and start over, here's a simple way to safely save your work:

- Go to the top-level of your GitHub repository, similar to `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY`
- Click the green "Clone or Download" button, and select Download Zip to receive a compressed folder of your repo contents on your computer.
- In your GitHub repo, click on Settings (upper-right area) and scroll down to Delete This Repository.
- To prevent accidental deletions, GitHub requires you to type in the REPOSITORY name.
- Now you can start over in one of these ways:
  - If you wish to [Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages](github-pages.html), follow that tutorial again.
  - OR
  - Fork another copy of the original GitHub repository to your account. After you create your copy, if you wish to add selected files that you previously downloaded to your computer, follow directions to [Upload Code with GitHub](create-repo) in the second half of this tutorial in this book

#### Problems with Creating a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages {-}
If you followed the [Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages tutorial](github-pages.html), it should have created two web links (or URLs):

- your code repository, in this format: `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY`
- your published web page, in this format: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`

Be sure to insert your GitHub username, and your GitHub repository name, in the general formats above.

These URLs are NOT case-sensitive, which means that `https://github.com/USERNAME` and `https://gitub.com/username` point to the same location.

##### My simple GitHub web page does not appear {-}
- Make sure that you are pointing to the correct URL for your published web page, in the format shown above.
- Be patient. During busy periods on GitHub, it may take up to 1 minute for new content to appear in your browser.
- Do a "hard refresh" to [bypass any saved content in your browser cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache).
  - Ctrl + F5 (most Windows-Linux browsers)
  - Command + Shift + R (Chrome or Firefox for Mac)
  - Shift + Reload button toolbar (Safari for Mac)
- Test the link to your published web page in a different browser. If you normally use Chrome, try Firefox.
- On rare occasions, the GitHub service or GitHub Pages feature may be down. Check <https://status.github.com>.

##### My simple GitHub web page does not display my iframe {-}
- If you followed the [Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages tutorial](github-pages) and inserted an iframe in the README.md file, it will appear in your published web page, under these conditions:
  - Ideally, your README.md should be the ONLY file in this GitHub repository
  - Any other files in your repo (such as index.html, default.html, or index.md) will block the iframe HTML code in your README.md from being published on the web. If you accidentally selected a GitHub Pages Theme, you need to delete any extra files it created: click each file, select trash can to delete it, and commit changes.

![Screenshot: Extra files in GitHub repo will block iframe in your README](images/08-github/extra-files-block-readme-iframe.png)

#### Problems with iframes {-}

##### My iframe does not appear in my web page {-}
- Go back to the [Embed tutorials in this book](embed.html) to double-check the directions
- Items listed in your iframe (such as the URL, width, or height) should be enclosed inside straight quotation marks (single or double)

- Use only `https` (the extra 's' means 'secure'), not `http`. Some web browsers will block content if it mixes http and https resources, and some code templates in this book require https.

- Use only straight quotes, not curly quotes. Avoid pasting text from a word-processor into GitHub, which can accidentally carry over curly quotes. Typing directly into the GitHub editor will create straight quotes.

#### Problems with Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets template {-}

##### My map does not appear {-}
1) Confirm that you have completed all of the key steps in the [Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets](leaflet-with-google-sheets) tutorial in this book, especially these:
  - Sign in to Google and File > Make a Copy of the Google Sheet to your Google Drive.
  - File > Publish your Google Sheet (Jack often forgets this key step!)
  - Copy your Google Sheet web address from top of your browser (usually ends with `...XYZ/edit#gid=0`) and paste into your `google-doc-url.js` file in your GitHub repo. Do NOT copy the *Published* web address (which usually ends with `...XYZ/pubhtml`)
  - When you paste your Google Sheet web address into `google-doc-url.js`, be careful not to erase single-quote marks or semicolon
  - Go to your live map link, which should follow this format: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`, refresh the browser, and wait at least 30 seconds.

2) Check your Google Sheet for errors:
- Do NOT rename column headers (in row 1) of any sheet, because the Leaflet Map code looks for these exact words.

- Do NOT rename row labels (in column A) of any sheet, due to the same reason above.

- In your Points tab, DO NOT leave any blank rows

3) Confirm on GitHub Status (https://status.github.com/) that all systems are operational.

4) If you cannot find the problem, go to the top of this page to Safely Delete Your GitHub Repo and Start Over. Also, make a new copy of the Google Sheet template, give it a new name, and copy data from your old sheet using File > Paste Special > Values Only.

#### Problems with Chart.js code templates {-}

##### Chart displays old data {-}
If you upload new data to your Chart.js code template on GitHub Pages, and it does not appear in your browser after refreshing and waiting up to one minute, then GitHub Pages is probably not the cause of the problem. Instead, some browsers continue to show "old" Chart.js in the web cache. The simplest solution is to File > Quit your browser and re-open the link to your Chart.js

#### Problems with Mac Computers {-}

##### No file extensions {-}

Several tools in this book will not work properly if your Mac Finder does not display file extensions. In other words, every file should include a period followed by several letters (such as data.csv and map.geojson). If you do not see these extensions at the end of each file name, then go to Finder > Preferences > Advanced and check the box to turn them on, as show below:

#### Solve Problems with Browser Developer Tools {-}
Peek inside any website and view the web code under the hood with the browser developer tools.

In Chrome for Mac, go to View > Developer > Developer Tools
