# Embed On Your Web {#embed}
TODO: Reorganize and rewrite chapter

After you create a chart or map, how do display it inside your website as an *interactive* visualization? Our goal is not a static picture, but a live chart or map that users can explore. This is an important question for beginners, since data visualizations are not valuable unless you can control where and how your work appears. This chapter walks you through the key steps.

First, you need to own a website that supports iframe codes (which we'll explain below). If you do not have a website that supports this, then follow this quick tutorial to [Create a simple web page with GitHub Pages](github-pages.html). Even if you already have a website, still do this tutorial, because it introduces a tool used many times in this book.

Second, you need to copy or create an iframe code from your chart or map. An iframe is one line of HTML code with instructions on how to display a web page from a specific address (called a URL). A simple iframe looks like this:

`<iframe src="https://handsondataviz.org/embed/index.html"></iframe>`

No coding skills are necessary. See these easy-to-follow examples:

-[Copy iframe from a Google Sheets chart](iframe-google-sheets.html)
-[Convert a link into an iframe](link-to-iframe.html)

Finally, you need to paste (or embed) the iframe code inside your website. Like a picture frame, an iframe allows you to display one web page (your data visualization) inside another web page (your personal website). But unlike a picture frame, where the image is static, an iframe makes content interactive, so visitors can explore the chart or map on your site, even though it may actually be hosted on an entirely different website. Go to this third tutorial, which combines the two steps above, called [Embed Iframe in GitHub Pages](iframe-github.html).

See more tutorials in this chapter to copy iframes from other visualization tools (such as [Tableau Public](iframe-tableau.html) and embed them in other common websites (such as [WordPress](iframe-wordpress.html), etc.) ** TO DO: add more tutorials and links **

## Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages {- #github-pages}
Question: After you create an interactive chart or map, how do you embed the live version in a website that you control?

The full answer requires three steps:

- 1) Create a web page that supports iframe codes
- 2) Copy or create an iframe code from your visualization
- 3) Embed (or paste) the iframe code into your web page

This tutorial focuses on the **first step**. If you don't already have your own website, or if you are not sure whether your site supports iframe codes, then follow the steps below. We will create a simple web page with a free and friendly tool called GitHub <http://github.com>, and host it on the public web with the built-in GitHub Pages feature. For **steps 2 and 3**, see the [Copy iframe from Google Sheets](iframe-google-sheets.html) tutorial and the [Embed iframe in GitHub Pages](iframe-github.html) tutorial in this chapter.

Tool review:
GitHub <http://github.com> is a versatile tool that can be used to create simple web pages.

- Pros:
  - Free and easy-to-learn tool to edit and host simple pages on the public web.
  - All steps below can be completed in your web browser.
- Cons:
  - All work on GitHub is public by default. Private repositories (folders) require payment.
  - New users sometimes confuse the links for code repositories versus published web pages.

[Video](https://youtube.be/AFdogZFyN0c)

1) Sign up for free GitHub account, then sign in, at <http://github.com>.

2) Create a new repository (also called a "project" or similar to a "folder").

3) Name your repository (or "repo"), and select Initialize with a README file. Optional steps: add a description and select a license.

4) Scroll down and click the green button to Create your repo, which will appear in a new browser tab, with this URL format:

`https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME`

5) In your GitHub repo, click on Settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages, select Master branch as your source, then Save. This publishes the code from your repo to the public web.

Hint: Do NOT select Theme Chooser for this exercise. It will create additional files that will interfere with displaying an iframe in your README.md file.

6) When the Settings page refreshes, scroll back down to GitHub Pages to see the new link to your published website, which will appear in this format:

`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME`

7) Right-click and Copy the link to your published web site.

8) At the top of the page, click on the repo name to return to the main level.

9) Click the README.md file to open it in your browser, and click the pencil symbol to edit it.

10) Inside your README.md file, paste the link to your published web site, and type any text you wish to appear. The .md extension refers to Markdown, an easy-to-read computer language that GitHub Pages can process.

11) Scroll down and click the green Commit button to save your edits.

12) When your GitHub repo page refreshes, click on the new link to go to your published web site.
**BE PATIENT!** Your new site may not appear instantly. Refresh the browser every 10 seconds. You may need to wait up to 1 minute for a new site to appear the first time, but later changes will be much faster.

Remember that GitHub Pages is designed to create simple web pages and sites. See other web publishing tools mentioned in this chapter to create more sophisticated web sites.

## Copy an iframe code from a Google Sheets interactive chart {- #iframe-google-sheets}
Question: After you create an interactive chart or map, how do you embed the live version in a website that you control?

The full answer requires three steps:

1. Create a web page that supports iframe codes
2. Copy the iframe code from your visualization
3. Embed (or paste) the iframe code into your web page

This tutorial focuses on the **second step**, and shows how to publish a Google Sheets interactive chart, and copy its iframe code. Details may differ for other visualization tools, but the general iframe concept will be similar to most cases. For **steps 1 and 3**, see the [Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages](github-pages.html) tutorial and the [Embed iframe in GitHub Pages](iframe-github.html) tutorial in this chapter.

#### Tutorial {-}

1) Create a Google Sheets chart, which requires a free Google Drive account. Learn more in the [Google Sheets Charts tutorial](charts-google-sheets.html) in this book.

2) Click the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the interactive chart and select Publish chart. Click OK on next screen.

![Screenshot: Drop-down menu to publish a Google Sheets chart](images/09-embed/google-sheets-chart-menu-publish.png)

3) Select the Embed tab, select the Interactive version, and click the blue Publish button. If you make changes to the chart, they will continue to be published to the web automatically, unless you click the Stop button or checkbox at the bottom.

![Screenshot: Publish to the web for a Google Sheets chart](images/09-embed/google-sheets-publish.png)

4) Copy the iframe embed code.

![Screenshot: Copy the iframe code from a Google Sheets chart](images/09-embed/google-sheets-publish-copy-iframe.png)

No coding skills are necessary, but it helps to be code-curious. This iframe is a line of HTML code that contains these instructions:

- iframe tags to mark the beginning and end
- width and height: to display your chart in a second site, in pixels
- seamless frameborder: "0" means no border will appear around the chart in the second site
- scrolling: "no" means the chart will not include its own web scrolling feature
- src: the web address (or URL) of the visualization to be displayed in the second site

See the next tutorial in this chapter, [Embed iframe in GitHub Pages](iframe-github.html), to learn how to paste the iframe into a simple web page. Or see related tutorials in this chapter to embed an iframe in other common web sites.

## Convert a Weblink into an Iframe {- #link-to-iframe}
After you publish your data visualization to the web, how do you convert its weblink (or URL) into an iframe, to embed in your personal website?

The answer depends: did you publish your visualization as a code template on GitHub Pages? Or did you publish it using a drop-and-drag tool such as Google Sheets or Tableau Public?

#### Published with a code template on GitHub Pages {-}
If you published your visualization from a code template (such as Leaflet or Chart.js) with GitHub Pages, follow these easy steps:

1) Copy the URL of your published visualization on GitHub, which will be in this format:
```html
https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY
```

2) Add `iframe` tags to the beginning and end, insert `src=` and enclose the URL inside quotation marks, like this:

`<iframe src="https://USERNAME.github.io/RESPOSITORY"></iframe>`

3) Optional: Insert preferred width and height (in pixels by default, or percentages), like this:

`<iframe src="https://USERNAME.github.io/RESPOSITORY" width="90%" height="400"></iframe>`

4) Go to the appropriate tutorial to embed your iframe in your personal website:

- [Embed an iframe in GitHub Pages](iframe-github.html)
- [Embed an iframe in WordPress.org](iframe-wordpress.html)

#### Published with Google Sheets or Tableau Public {-}

Or, if you published your visualization using a drop-and-drag tool, see these tutorials:

- [Copy an iframe code from a Google Sheets interactive chart](iframe-google-sheets.html)
- [Embed Tableau Public on your Website](iframe-tableau.html)

## Embed an Iframe in GitHub Pages {- #iframe-github}
Question: After you create an interactive chart or map, how do you embed the live version in a website that you control?

Here's the full three-step answer that combines lessons from the [Embed on the Web chapter introduction](embed.html) and the two previous tutorials:

1) First, create a web page that supports iframe embed codes. If you don't know what that means or don't yet have a personal website, go back to the previous tutorial, [Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages](github-pages.html), or see the video and step-by-step instructions below.

2) Second, copy or create an iframe code from your data visualization. Go back to the previous tutorial, [Copy an iframe code from a Google Sheets interactive chart](iframe-google-sheets.html), or see the video and step-by-step instructions below.

3) Third, embed (or paste) the iframe code into your website. The video and instructions below show how to paste an iframe from a Google Sheets interactive chart into a simple web page with GitHub Pages.

Try it:

The goal is to embed the iframe code from a Google Sheets interactive chart, which resides on a Google web server, into your GitHub Pages web site. The result will be similar to the one below:

TODO: Convert to code-chunk iframe: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YgBWYm9nTGlCuyqSwU3SDb7xk-SMSPgjfYq5iLqL0nQ/pubchart?oid=200651442&amp;format=interactive

[Video](https://youtube.be/enjhlnqaXOE]

1) Sign up for free GitHub account, then sign in, at <https://github.com>.

2) Create a **new repository** (think of it as a folder that contains your project).

3) Name your repository (or "repo"), and select *Initialize this repository with a README*. Optional steps: add a description and select a license.

4) Scroll down and click the green button to Create your repo, which will appear in a new browser tab, with this URL format:

`https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME`

5) In your GitHub repo, click on Settings tab, scroll down to *GitHub Pages*, select **master branch** as your Source, then Save. This publishes the code from your repo to the public web.

6) When the Settings page refreshes, scroll back down to GitHub Pages to see the new link to your published website, which will appear in this format:

`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME`

7) Right-click and Copy this link to your published web site.

8) At the top of the page, click on the repo name to return to the main level.

9) Click the README.md file to open it in your browser, and click the pencil symbol in the upper right corner to edit it.

10) Inside your README.md file, paste the link to your published web site, and type any text you wish to appear. The .md extension refers to Markdown, an easy-to-read markup language that GitHub Pages can process and display as HTML.

11) Go to a data visualization you have created, such as a Google Sheets chart, select Publish > Embed, and copy the iframe code. This line of HTML code displays the interactive visualization website inside your personal website.  

12) Scroll down and click Commit to save your edits.

13) When your GitHub repo page refreshes, click on the new link to go to your published web site.
**BE PATIENT!** Your new site may not appear instantly. Refresh the browser every 10 seconds. You may need to wait for a few minutes for a new site to appear the first time, but later changes will be much faster.

Important:

- A published README.md file will display an HTML iframe code, unless you add other HTML files (such as index.html) to your repository.

Remember that GitHub Pages is designed to create simple web pages and sites. See other web publishing tools mentioned in this chapter to create more sophisticated web sites.

## Embed an Iframe on WordPress.org {- #iframe-wordpress}
TODO:

- rewrite this tutorial to merge the two versions (top and bottom)
- then update all links and check all `code` tags

To embed one web page (the data visualization) inside a second web page (the organization's website), we use a simple HTML code known as **iframe**. (Read more about the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp">iframe</a><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp">tag at W3Schools</a>.)

The **general iframe concept** works across many data visualization tools and many websites:
- Copy the embed code or URL from your dataviz website
- Paste (and modify) the code as an iframe in your destination website

To embed your dataviz in a self-hosted Wordpress.org site, the [iframe plugin] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/) must be installed and activated. This plugin allows authors to embed iframe codes inside posts/pages, in a modified "shortcode" format surrounded by square brackets. Without the plugin, self-hosted WordPress.org sites will usually "strip out" iframe codes for all users except the site administrator. **I have already installed and activated** the iframe plugin on my site, and the Dashboard view looks like this:

![](images/09-embed/WordPressOrg-iframe-plugin-activate.jpg)

Note that most WordPress.com sites do NOT support an iframe embed code.

But details vary, so read and experiment with the examples that follow.


5) To embed the iframe in a WordPress.org site, the iframe plugin must be installed, as explained in the [Embed with iframe on WordPress.org](iframe-wordpress.html) chapter. **TO DO** fix self-reference

6) Log into your Wordpress.org site and create a new post. In the editor window, switch from the Visual to the Text tab, which allows users to modify the code behind your post. Paste the iframe code from your interactive dataviz.

![](images/09-embed/WordPressOrg-text-tab-paste-iframe.png)

7) Initially, the code you pasted includes HTML iframe tags at the front `<iframe...` and the end `...></iframe>`, which looks like this:

`<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fwnl5hvkkwz-YDZrogyGnx274BqmozGlIeXyjJ2TKmE/pubchart?oid=462316012&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>`

8) Modify the front end of the iframe code by replacing the less-than symbol ( < ) with a square opening bracket ( [ ). Modify the back end by erasing the greater-than symbol ( > ) and the end tag ( </iframe> ). Replace the back end with a square closing bracket ( ] ).

![](images/09-embed/WordPressOrg-replace-with-bracket.png)

Your modified code should look like this:

`[iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fwnl5hvkkwz-YDZrogyGnx274BqmozGlIeXyjJ2TKmE/pubchart?oid=462316012&amp;format=interactive"]`

9) Click Preview or Publish/View Post to see how it appears on the web.

10) If desired, continue to modify the iframe code to improve the display of your dataviz on your website. For example, the initial code was 600 pixels wide (width="600"). To display the dataviz across the full width of your website, change this part of the code to 100% (width="100%").

The goal is to embed an interactive chart inside your website, so that users can explore the data. This tutorial displays a *very basic chart* to simplify the process, and the end result will appear like the one below. Try it.

## Embed Tableau Public on your Website {- #iframe-tableau}
Question: After learning [how to create an interactive data visualization with Tableau Public](tableau-public.html) in this book, how do I embed it on my website?

Answer: Tableau Public supports two embedding methods, and your choice depends on your type of website.

- A) Embed code: if you can paste directly into an HTML web page
- B) Convert Link to iframe: to paste into WordPress.org, Wix, SquareSpace, Weebly, and many other web platforms

Try it:

Both methods produce an embedded visualization like the one below. Float your cursor over points to view data details.

TODO: convert to code-chunk iframe: https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true

#### A) Embed code method for HTML web pages {-}

1) Use this method if you can paste HTML and JavaScript code directly into a website with HTML pages.

2) Go to the public web page of any Tableau Public visualization, such as this sample: https://public.tableau.com/profile/jackdougherty#!/vizhome/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1

3) Before you begin the embed process, click the upper-right Edit Details button to make any final modifications to the title or toolbar settings.

4) Click the bottom-right Share button, click inside the **Embed Code** field, and copy its contents. A typical embed code is a long string of HTML and JavaScript instructions to display the visualization.

![Screenshot: Edit and Share buttons in Tableau Public web page](images/09-embed/tableau-edit-share.png)

5) Open an HTML page on your website and paste the embed code in the body section. Below is an example of a sample Tableau Public embed code pasted between the body tags of a simple HTML page.

</body>
</html>
```

#### B) Convert Link to iframe method {-}

1) Use this method if you need to paste an iframe into common web authoring platforms (such as WordPress.org, Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, etc.), since these platforms typically do not support HTML and JavaScript code pasted directly into content.

2) Go to the public web page of any Tableau Public visualization, such as this sample: <https://public.tableau.com/profile/jackdougherty#!/vizhome/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1>

3) Before you begin the embed process, click the upper-right Edit Details button to make any final modifications to the title or toolbar settings.

4) Click the bottom-right Share button, click inside the **Link** field (NOT the Embed Code field), and copy its contents.

![Screenshot: Edit and Share buttons in Tableau Public web page](images/09-embed/tableau-edit-share.png)

5) A typical link will look similar to this example (scroll to right to see all):

`https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes`

6) We need to edit the link to convert it into an iframe format. First, delete any code that appears after the question mark, to make it look like this (scroll to right to see all):

`https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?`

7) Add this snippet of code to the end, to replace what you deleted above:

`:showVizHome=no&:embed=true`

8) Now your edited link should look similar to this (scroll to right to see all):

`https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true`

9) Enclose the link inside an iframe source tag `src=` with quotes, to make it look similar to this (scroll to right to see all):

`src="https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" `

10) Add iframe tags for `width` and `height` in percentages or pixels (default), to make it look similar to this (scroll to right to see all):

`src="https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" width="90%" height="500" `

Hint: Insert 90% width, rather than 100, to help readers easily scroll down your web page

11) Add iframe tags at the beginning and end, to make it look similar to this (scroll to right to see all):

`<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" width="90%" height="500"></iframe>`

Exceptions to the last step above. As described in the [Embed iframe on WordPress](embed.html#iframe-wordpress) chapter in this book, in a self-hosted WordPress.org site, with the iframe plugin, insert iframe brackets rather than HTML tags to make a shortcode like this (scroll to right to see all):

`[iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" width="90%" height="500"]`
