## Notes and Bibliography {- #notes}
This book displays endnotes for each chapter in the HTML book, and footnotes at the bottom of pages for the PDF and MS Word books, followed by an alphabetized bibliography of all references cited on the last page. The notes and bibliography also appear in the full-book Markdown file.

To create notes, insert citation keys in the text, such as `@huffHowLieStatistics1954`, which are generated by [Zotero bibliographic database](http://zotero.org) with the [Better BibTex extension](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), and export these in the *Better BibLaTeX* format into the `dataviz.bib` in the book repo. The repo also contains `.csl` file to generate the notes and bibliography in a specific Chicago-style format, downloaded from the [Zotero Styles Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles). These instructions are referenced in the `index.Rmd` file for both the HTML and PDF formats, as shown in these excerpts:

```
bibliography: dataviz.bib
citation-style: chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl
...
output:
  bookdown::gitbook:
    ...
    pandoc_args: [ "--csl", "chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl" ]

  bookdown::pdf_book:
    ...
    citation_package: none
    pandoc_args: [ "--csl", "chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl" ]
```

Here's a text-only note, with no Zotero citation.^[This is a note, with no bibliographic reference.]

To create a note with citations only, separate Zotero/BibTeX citation keys with semi-colons: ^[@huffHowLieStatistics1954; @monmonierHowLieMaps1996]

Since notes also may include text and punctuation in Markdown syntax, always insert a caret symbol prior to the brackets to demarcate a note:^[Compare how "lying" is justified by @huffHowLieStatistics1954, pp. 10-11 and @monmonierHowLieMaps1996, pp. 11-12.]

Note that the `chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl` format automatically shortens the note after it its first reference.
