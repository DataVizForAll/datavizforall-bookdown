# Find and Know Your Data {#find}

When searching for information for a visualization project, ask yourself these questions to find and know your data:


- Which organizations might have collected or published data on this topic?
  - government agencies
  - academic institutions
  - non-governmental or non-profit organizations
  - open data repositories, which may be operated by any of the above....
- What level of data is available: individual cases or aggregated into larger groups?
  - for example, education data sometimes available at individual student level (explain), but due to privacy laws, is more likely made public in larger groups (school data, district data, state data)
- When is the most current data available?




Once you've located some relevant information, get to know your data. Closely examine your data files to understand their meaning, sources of origin, and limitations.

- Where did it come from?
- For what purpose was this data originally collected?
- What do the data labels really mean? Ideally, go out into the field to directly observe how the original data is measured and collected
- Is this the *most* recent version, in the *best* available format?
- Whose perspectives does your data privilege? Whose stories remain untold?



## Recognize Bad Data {- #bad}

## Source Your Data {- #source}
One way to avoid "bad data" is to source your data every time you download or create a new file. Spell out exactly where it came from, so that someone other than you, several years in the future, could understand its origin and limitations.

The first step is to thoughtfully label every file name. All of us have experienced bad file names like these:

  - data.xls
  - bldgdatalist.csv
  - data77.xls

Write a short but meaningful file name. While there is no perfect system, a good strategy is to include data source keywords, such as `acs2018`, `worldbank`, or `eurostat`. If you or co-workers will be working on different versions of a downloaded file, include the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Replace blank spaces with dashes (`-`) or underscores (`_`). Good file names look like this:

  - town-demographics-2019-12-02.xls
  - census2010_population_by_county.csv
  - eurostat-1999-2019-CO2_emissions.xlsx

Save your notes inside the spreadsheet the contains the data. Add a new tab named *notes* that describes the origins of the data, a longer description for any abbreviated labels, and when it was last updated. Add your own name and give credit to any collaborators who helped you.

Make a duplicate of the original dataset before editing. For simple spreadsheets, a quick solution is to right-click on the tab containing the data, to make a copy to another tab as a backup. Label your backup and leave it alone!

TODO: Fix image to match above

```{r spreadsheet-copy-sheet}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("images/02-spreadsheet/SpreadsheetCopySheet640w.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("images/placeholder.jpg")
```

## Public or Private Data? {- #public}

Many of the free web-based tools in this book require that your publicly share your data. Check each tool and decide whether it is appropriate for your data, which may have some privacy restrictions.

In some cases, individual data privacy is protected by law, but a government agency may aggregate (sort into larger groups) or anonymize (remove personally identifiable details) data to make it public. For example:

- Individual-level census data is private for about 70 years, but the US Census Bureau publicly releases anonymous data for aggregated areas (such as census blocks, tracts, towns, etc.)
- Patient-level health records are private, but public health officials share town- and county-level health data.
- Student-level education data is private, but school districts and state agencies publicly share grade-level and school-level data.

In other cases, individual data is not private. For example:

- When individuals contribute to political campaigns, most US and state laws require that the donor name, address, and amount is public data.
- When an individual buys home in Connecticut, the owner's name, address, purchase amount, and other details about the home are public data.

Under US law, you cannot copyright data, such as the raw information in the rows and columns of a spreadsheet. But you can copy, but representations of data can be protected by copyright. ... explain...  In the spirit of openness, we encourage you to share your data visualizations under a Creative Commons license... explain... in fact, this book is copyrighted, and the source text is publicly available under a Creative Commons TODO: TYPE license...

In the US, federal and state governments are subject to different versions of the Freedom of Information Act, and people often refer to sending a "FOIA" request... explain and link.... Some government agencies delay action or reject requests, and some requests appeal to review boards or take other legal actions.... Governments often find that fighting open information requests can be expensive, so some have begun to share more on open data repositories...


## Open Data Repositories {-}
TODO: Explain growth of open data platforms, and why they matter...

- View and export: At minimum, most open data repositories allow users to view their data and export it into common spreadsheet formats. Some also provide geographical boundaries for polygon maps.
- Built-in visualization tools: Some repositories offer built-in tools for users to create interactive charts or maps on the platform site. Some also provide code snippets for users to embed these built-in visualizations into their own websites.
- Static and Live data: Most repositories offer static datasets for a specific time period, but some also provide "live" data that is continuously updated.
- Application Programming Interface (APIs): Some repositories provide endpoints with code instructions that allow users to pull data directly from the platform into an external sites or online visualization, which is ideal for continuously updated data.

While we would love to offer a comprehensive list of all open data repositories, that's not possible because...

Instead, the best we can do is to briefly mention types of places where we commonly go looking for data...

Data.gov (https://www.data.gov/) is the official open data repository for US federal government agencies, managed by the US General Services Administration, and powered by an open-source CKAN and WordPress platform.


The [U.S. Census Bureau](https://census.gov) collects and shares population, housing, and economic data on its open repositories. The Decennial Census is a full count of the population every ten years, while the American Community Survey (ACS) (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) is an annual sample count which produces various one-year, three-year, or five-year estimates for different census geographies, with margins of error.

Data.census.gov (https://data.census.gov) is the main platform to access US Census data. It provides an easy search across census and survey tables. There is an interface to view tables for various years and geographies, and a download button to save data as CSV or PDF. It replaced American FactFinder (https://factfinder.census.gov) in July 2019.

Social Explorer (https://www.socialexplorer.com/) is a popular tool to view and download census and related demographic data, past and present. The platform allows users to create data maps that may be exported as static images or presentation slides. Social Explorer requires subscription, but many academic institutions provide access. TODO: describe how it contains rich data, including historical census.... but currently free only for a 14-day trial period... several academic institutions have paid subscriptions to their students, staff, and faculty.
