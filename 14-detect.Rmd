# Detect Bias in Data Stories {#detect}
TODO: Rewrite chapter

While we like to believe data visualizations simply "tell the truth," when you dig further into this topic, you realize that there are multiple ways to represent reality. In this chapter, you will learn how visualizations display the biases of the people and the software that create them. Although we cannot stop bias, we can teach people to look for and detect it, and be aware of our own.

Sections in this chapter:

- [How to Lie with Charts](how-to-lie-with-charts.html), inspired by Darrell Huff (1954)
- [How to Lie with Maps](how-to-lie-with-maps.html), inspired by Mark Monmonier (1996)


TODO: Build on themes from the new intro: Both maps make valid interpretations of the data, but generate very different impressions. You may be surprised to learn that mapmakers have few universal guidelines when selecting ranges or colors, other than a general dictum to make “honest and useful” decisions. Different mapmakers could choose to divide the legend into three, or four, or five ranges, and all would be correct. Furthermore, they could choose to divide ranges into equal intervals (such as quartiles or quintiles) or intervals that vary according to patterns in the data (such as standard deviations from the mean).
Just like charts, we can mislead and lie with maps, but we can also create very different pictures of the truth.

## How to Lie with Charts {- #how-to-lie-with-charts}
One of the best ways to learn how to detect bias in data visualization is to intentionally manipulate a chart, and tell two (or more) opposing stories with the same data. You’ll learn what to watch out for when viewing other people’s charts, and think more carefully about the ethical issues when you design your own.

This exercise was inspired by a classic book published more than fifty years ago: Darrell Huff, *How to Lie with Statistics* (W. W. Norton & Company, 1954), http://books.google.com/books?isbn=0393070875

Right-click this link and Save to download this sample data in CSV format to your computer: [us-gross-domestic-product-per-capita](data/us-gross-domestic-product-per-capita.csv). This historical data on economic productivity comes from the World Bank, World Development Indicators, http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators

Upload the CSV file to your Google Drive (with Settings to Convert to Google format) to create a Google Sheet.

Select the data cells and Insert > Chart > Line chart, similar to the default version shown below:

In your Google Sheet chart, double-click the vertical y-axis to edit the Minimum and Maximum values.

![Screenshot: Edit the Min and Max values of the Y-axis](images/14-detect/y-axis-min-max.png)

Make the line look "flatter" (slower economic growth) by lowering the minimum to $36,000, and increasing the maximum to $100,000, as shown below:

Make the line look like a "sharper increase" (faster economic growth) by increasing the minimum to $38,000, and lowering maximum to $52,000, as shown below:

## How to Lie with Maps {- #how-to-lie-with-maps}
One of the best ways to learn how to detect bias in data visualization is to intentionally manipulate a map, and tell two (or more) opposing stories with the same data.

This exercise was inspired by Mark S. Monmonier, *How to Lie with Maps, 2nd ed.* (University of Chicago Press, 1996), http://books.google.com/books?isbn=0226534219

First, scroll through this data on Median Household Income for Hartford-area towns, 2011-15, from American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Or right-click to [open this Google Sheet in a new tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13bFHsXJtADIkUCGgjpO76RjrV0OAu62hzK-J3bXEVsk/edit#gid=556312122).

Next, explore two different polygon maps of the same data. Use the drop-down menu to compare "Extreme Differences" versus "Uniform Equality"

Why are these two maps portray the same data so differently? To see the answer, look at the data ranges. . ..
