# Detect Lies and Reduce Bias {#detect}
TODO: Revise chapter

In the introduction, we lied to you... intentionally... by showing you visualizations that portrayed reality is very different ways.

In this chapter, you'll improve your lie detector skills in the realm of dataviz, and also work to reduce more subtle biases in your own dataviz.

While we like to believe data visualizations simply "tell the truth," when you dig further into this topic, you realize that there are multiple ways to represent reality.

People can mislead with charts and maps, but we can also create very different pictures of the truth....

You may be surprised to learn that there's not one *right* way to create a chart or a map. In the field of data visualization, we have only a few hard rules about how *not* to design, such as [REFER to chart and map design sections]. Even some of those "rules" are disputed.

In general, data visualization is guided by a general dictum to make "honest and useful decisions" (cite Datawrapper); Alberto Cairo adds that visualizations should be "truthful...functional....beautiful...insightful...."

That leaves a lot of room for interpretation... some of which is intentionally misleading, and some of it is thoughtlessly misinformed....unintentional.... but nevertheless sways how people view our visualizations...

In this chapter, you will learn how visualizations display the biases of the people and the software that create them.



While we cannot stop bias entirely, we can teach you to detect it in charts and maps made by other people, as well as those that you make, to improve your interpretation...

The best way to improve your lie detector skills is to learn various ways to intentionally manipulate data visualizations, to better understand how people might be lying to you. Since our book features hands-on tutorials, in the sections below we'll walk you through the steps of creating *biased* charts and maps, so that you'll know how to make *better* ones.

As the saying goes, it takes a thief to catch a thief: learn *how to lie* to avoid being fooled by other people's misleading charts and maps, and also so that you *tell the truth* in your own visualizations.

Since our book features hands-on lessons, in each section you'll learn how to create *biased* visualizations, so that you'll know how to make *better* ones. Just like it takes a thief to catch a thief... you need to learn how to lie in order to be more truthful in your visualizations...

These tutorials on "how to lie" were inspired by several sources....

## Avoid Bad Visualizations {- #bad-visualizations}
TODO: can this be reduced to 1-2 paragraphs with refs to chart and map design sections, rather than its own section?
Some visualizations are so poorly designed, with obvious errors, that we *can* declare these to be *wrong*.
Whether intentional or otherwise, no room for interpretation here... We warned you about some of these mistakes in the chart design and map design sections of this book.
- Examples: pie charts that add up to more than 100%


## How to Lie with Charts {- #how-to-lie-with-charts}
In this section, you'll learn how to avoid being fooled by misleading charts, and also how to make your own charts more honest, by intentionally manipulating data to tell two (or more) opposing stories. This tutorial will teach you to watch out for several details when viewing other people's charts, including [TODO LIST ELEMENTS HERE]. By learning you *how to lie*, our goal is to make you think about the ethics of *telling the truth* when you design your data stories.

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues we face on our planet, and it's also a topic where data has been manipulated by those who deny the problem.[TODO: Cite Cairo examples]. In this tutorial, we'll examine global temperature data from 1880 to the present, compiled by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). First, you'll create a *truthful* chart that shows how the mean global temperature has risen about 1 degree Celsius (or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit) during the past fifty years, which has already begun to cause glacial melt and rising sea levels [TODO: check wording]. Next, you'll use the same data to create *misleading* charts that use different strategies to *diminish* the appearance of temperature change. The inspiration for this specific tutorial came from a [high school classroom activity](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/teach/activity/graphing-global-temperature-trends/) created by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), as well as visualization expert Alberto Cairo's analysis of charts by climate change deniers.^[@nasajplEducatorGuideGraphing2017; @cairoHowChartsLie2019, pp. 65-67, 135-141]

1. Open the [global temperature change 1880-2019 data in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Npc7ozRjlsgRLLEV_B5zBvqyRqL6akE2qrEIGegHfGU/edit#gid=0), and go to *File > Save As* to create a copy that you can edit in your own Google Drive. We'll create the charts in Google Sheets, but you can also download the data to use in a different chart tool if you prefer.

2. Examine the data and read the notes. Temperature change refers to the mean global land-ocean surface temperature in degrees Celsius, estimated from many samples around the earth, relative to the temperature in 1951-1980, about 14°C (or 57°F). In other words, the 0.98 value for 2019 means that global temperatures were about 1°C above normal that year. Scientists define the 1951-80 period as "normal" based on standards from NASA and the US National Weather Service, and also because it's a familiar reference for many of today's adults who grew up during those decades. While there's other ways to measure temperature change, this data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA/GISS) is generally consistent with data compiled by other scientists at the [Climatic Research Unit](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/) and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series) (NOAA).

3. Let's see the *default* chart created by Google Sheets... While we never automatically accept a default chart as the truth, it's a good place to begin. Add a title and better vertical axis labels from the notes to clarify how temperature change is measured. ....

TODO: redesign exercise parts and sample data for all or most

- Ex #1: Lie (or Mislead?) by reducing appearance of increasing (either inequality data from intro, or climate change temp data from Cairo 2019 p65)
- start with Google Sheet default, but don't accept defaults!
- lie by hiding data on horizontal X-axis (show only low-growth years)
- lie by extending vertical Y-axis scale above and below the data range
- lie by reducing the chart aspect ratio to flatten appearance
- lie by adding a 2nd line and a dual axis

- Ex #2: use column chart data and goal is to exaggerate small diffs
- lie by starting the vertical axis at level higher than 0%
- lie with 3D and perspective (see Cairo 2019 p58)


Right-click this link and Save to download this sample data in CSV format to your computer: [us-gross-domestic-product-per-capita](data/us-gross-domestic-product-per-capita.csv). This historical data on economic productivity comes from the World Bank, World Development Indicators, http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators

Upload the CSV file to your Google Drive (with Settings to Convert to Google format) to create a Google Sheet.

Select the data cells and Insert > Chart > Line chart, similar to the default version shown below:

## How to Lie with Maps {- #how-to-lie-with-maps}
- TODO: reorganize exercise into more distinctive parts and sample data
- Lie with raw counts rather than percentages in choropleth map (which will show pop density; Cairo 2019 p132); need to normalize data
- Lie (or mislead?) with ranges (make analogy with histogram chart buckets & sizes)
- lie with color choices
- Lie with map area
- Lie with projection (or discuss as related to map area?)

One of the best ways to learn how to detect bias in data visualization is to intentionally manipulate a map, and tell two (or more) opposing stories with the same data. You’ll learn what to watch out for when viewing other people’s maps, and think more carefully about the ethical issues when you design your own.

Both maps make valid interpretations of the data, but generate very different impressions. You may be surprised to learn that mapmakers have few universal guidelines when selecting ranges or colors, other than a general dictum to make “honest and useful” decisions. Different mapmakers could choose to divide the legend into three, or four, or five ranges, and all would be correct. Furthermore, they could choose to divide ranges into equal intervals (such as quartiles or quintiles) or intervals that vary according to patterns in the data (such as standard deviations from the mean).

This exercise was inspired by Mark S. Monmonier, *How to Lie with Maps, 2nd ed.* (University of Chicago Press, 1996), http://books.google.com/books?isbn=0226534219

First, scroll through this data on Median Household Income for Hartford-area towns, 2011-15, from American Community Survey 5-year estimates.

Next, explore two different polygon maps of the same data. Use the drop-down menu to compare "Extreme Differences" versus "Uniform Equality"

Why are these two maps portray the same data so differently? To see the answer, look at the data ranges. . ..

## How to Lie with Words {- #how-to-lie-with-words}

Now that we've focused on charts and maps, think more carefully about the words we choose when designing our visualizations...

Framing Bias: Watch for negative versus positive framing and how it affects readers. For example, British statistician David Spiegelhalter notes that US hospitals report *mortality rates*, while UK hospitals report *survival* rates. When considering the risks of a surgical procedure for member of your family, a 5 percent mortality rate sounds worse than a 95 percent survival rate, even they're mathematically identical. Furthermore, augmenting the rate with raw numbers (such as 20 deaths out of 400 patients) raises the impression of risk even higher, because we begin to imagine real people's lives, not abstract percentages.^[@spiegelhalterArtStatisticsLearning2019, pp. 22-5]

## Different Types of Data Bias {- #data-bias}

Bias occurs when we unfairly favor one view over another. Different types of bias....(we already mentioned statistical biases in the Compare Appropriate Data chapter...)

We use the term to refer to biased people who prejudge something before evaluating the evidence. While some forms of bias are clearer to recognize, such as racial or gender bias,....Some biases are baked into human cognition and hard to avoid in data viz, unless you call it out

- Pattern Bias: tendency to see patterns in random data. Avoid it by remind readers that data is noisy and use statistical tests to determine likelihood of results due to change, covered in many books on statistical analysis.
- Confirmation Bias: accept claims that fit our preconceived notions...(see dataviz experiments in Cario book, Thaler?). Avoid it by looking at data with open eyes, and search out competing interpretations

We also refer to biases that are baked into the software that humans create.
- Algorithm or machine learning bias: human-written code, or machine-learning that follows inductive reasoning standards set up by humans, can lead to biased results, especially in facial recognition across racial groups, or discrimination in home lending. examples: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/upshot/housing-discrimination-algorithms-hud.html; https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/04/16/why-a-proposed-hud-rule-could-worsen-algorithm-driven-housing-discrimination/

## Reducing Racial Bias in Visualizations {- #racial-bias}
- Example: Map with “empty” land ignoring indigenous people https://twitter.com/indigenia/status/1308406887231246337?s=12
- sidenote: that wasn't how the original map creator designed or labeled the map, but others interpreted it this way
- how to address: clarify map biases....
